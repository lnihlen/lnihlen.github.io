The short weeks always seem harder, probably because I have to try and cram
five days of meetings in to four. One bright spot was getting home to Hilary,
back from so many days gone, and with dinner picked up from Charlie Hong Kong's
as well as pumpkins to carve.

We put Nightmare Before Christmas on first, when that finished up transitioned
to Ghostbusters. I carved Aku from Samurai Jack, a likely subject for a future
tattoo, and Hilary carved the dog Zero from Nightmare Before Christmas.

We've been using a new technique of only removing some of the skin of the
pumpkin, instead of cutting all the way through. This allows for gradation of
light through the pumpkin (if we had the skill), but more importantly frees
you from having to worry about closed forms not being able to float unsupported
inside of the pumpkin shell after being cut entirely from it. I think they turn
out better each year.

One thing I particularly appreciate about Hilary is hear creation of ritual in
our family. We don't have kids, we do these things for ourselves. And I think
I like it better this way.
