Slept in, worked out, cooked some beans, then set in on some more work, briefly,
on advancing the progress on the Raspberry Pi Gentoo project.

Bruno sent around an email about the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
rehearsal for tomorrow evening. He wants to experiment with the Utopia stuff,
along with rehearsal of the two pieces we've already been working on. I wish
I had made some more progress on Utopia investigation but I'm also not too sure
what to do with it. There's parts on order for a server that can provide
DHCP-based static IPs for the individual laptops, along with a multiport
Gigabit Ethernet switch.

The other plan is to get the RPi cluster up and use that to characterize the
intra-machine jitter. Need a better name for that metric, but I'd like to study,
from pulse to pulse, the time series of pulses emitted from the individual
clients when synchronizing. Actually, it makes me curious to measure the
classical jitter on an RPi when rendering a regular `TempoClock`. The idea is
to use a multi-track recording of the outputs from the individual clients
and measure from there. I'm also curious to see just how different kinds of
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} output look after an A/D then
D/A pass.

Anyway, I swear I haven't been slacking! Maybe some additional requirements will
help. It'd be good to brainstorm with the group about what compositional or
performative elements they'd like to see built on top of the synchronization
features of Utopia.

Also, time to scour the house one more time for interesting objects for contact
mics. Yay for rehearsal!
