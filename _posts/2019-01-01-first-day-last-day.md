Today is the first day of the new year and my last day of vacation. Bit
bittersweet, that. I think work will be a nice change of pace, actually. But
it's been good to be away and think of other things for a time. I took some
time to travel over the hill today and meet with Bruno for a quick runthrough
of all the tech I've been building for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}.
Things went relatively smoothly, given the tight timelines and the fact that we
were trying out a bunch of code fresh off my development workstation. Found
and fixed a few small showstopping bugs, and of course found a big whopper
of a bug in the network clock synchronization that will have to wait until I
can carve out a minute to tackle it.

Hil had business over the hill as well so we met for dinner, but none of the
places we could think of to eat at were open, so it was back home and then to
Saturn for dinner.

Watched a little TV and before you know it was time for bed. I don't know what
I was expecting, I guess, maybe fireworks or something? Nope, it's just back
to the routine. Feels good, actually, to be thinking of my schedule the next
few weeks and lining up the progress I want to make, the goals for the year.

Time marches on either way, so not a ton of use in trying to hold it back.
Should be a good year.
