The upgrade to first class for the flight back home was only $30 so I put it on
my own expense and splurged for it. I had been a bit nervous about the flight
situation so I arrived plenty early, but had a ton of time before takeoff to
sit and hack on {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code.

Then it was a plush ride back home, with plenty of room for the laptop and a
cup of coffee and banana to tide me over. We got in a bit early, I grabbed my
bag, and Hilary was there to pick me up. It was great to see her after a week.

We grabbed Ethiopian at Walia in San Jose, and then went over to REI to pick
up a new backpack for me, my current one having failed me on the trip to Las
Vegas. The one I actually liked the best was one of the cheapest in the store.

Then it was home to see the animals at home. After a week in the desert, and a
week of rain here, everything seems so green and lush. It was lovely to have
some cuddles with the doggies.

I finally finished up the latest
[SCLOrkNet](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkNet) work on the SLOrkWire. That's
all checked in, and then I had some time start refactoring the SCLOrkChat code
to use wires. I think the SCLOrkWire work is going to simplify the chat
implementation significantly.

Pretty damn good day.
