I had made a multi-track recording using the MacBook Pro last night of the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal. The group was eager to hear
it mixed down, so I thought I might take another crack at Ardour on the Gentoo
workstation. I have to admit the first time I tried to run Ardour on this
machine it hard-locked it, but to be fair I've had a couple of hard-locks with
other audio software on this computer so it's not the end of the world.

I was happy to report that this time Ardour booted up without incident and I was
able, after some fumbling around, to make good headway on the editing. Although
I'm not quite done. First impressions are it's a pretty cool and very capable
audio editing package, once you learn the ins and outs.

That's the third time Hilary has asked me about bedtime, and I think it's really
coming from her concern about my well-being now, about the crazy lack of sleep
I get during the working week, so I think on that note we're done.
