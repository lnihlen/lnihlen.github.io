Two more movies in our Lynda Thompson project tonight, the very generically
named [Love Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Affair_%281994_film%29)
followed by [Junior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_%281994_film%29).

Spent some more time on {% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %}. For some reason
I'm getting a crash on my laptop only when running any of the Halide generator
programs. No progress on that one, besides some observations. One is that I have
clang 7 on my laptop vs clang 6 on my desktop, where it does work. So it might
be worth uninstalling 7 on the laptop and trying out 6. Another thing I noticed
is the generators are find generating pseudocode, like html, and only crash
when I try to get them to generate bytecode, like with object files or archives.

Starting in on the implementation of MSSIM stuff. Trying to figure out creative
ways to test a weighted mean and standard deviation function without
re-implementing them on the test side.

Got the camper repaired this morning, turns out I had forgotten to drain the
hot water heater, and the corrosion protection plug did its job in that it
corroded, but it then deteriorated and plugged up the rest of the plumbing in
the camper. So I took it down to a local RV repair shop here in Santa Cruz and
they fixed it right up. We're thinking of taking the camper out on Monday again
for another try at China Camp, but the replacement mattress hasn't arrived yet.

Might still be worth going anyway, we'll see.
