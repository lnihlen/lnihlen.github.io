The last of the leftovers vanished during lunch, which really did for some
reason make the day feel like the true end of the Christmas season. I spent the
day cuddling with the dogs on the couch and grinding away on my laptop on my
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} homework. In particular, I had left
a laundry list of items for myself yesterday and got through all of them,
save documentation and packaging.

Hilary's got her radio show tomorrow so I'm thinking that will be a good time to
dig in to the documentation work and package the quark into its first release
version. Then I can ping Bruno, the SCLOrk conductor, about the new Quark
packaging method and ask him to test out the new chat version.

But that was basically it for the day. It's a treat to spend a day just grinding
out code, don't get to do that too often. But I also feel a bit worn out by it.
I think if I can get through all my homework in the next few days I might take
a short break from hacking, at least on this particular project.

Of course, I've been feeling the itch to take another look at
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} again. So maybe that is on the radar.
And there's always Scintillator, the long-deferred Supercollider graphics
project.
