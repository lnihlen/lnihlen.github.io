Last night I experienced the worst case of insomnia in long memory. I know at
least part of the cold I got was due to stress at work, and perhaps having a
few days of forced rest and detachment allowed everything to catch up to me.
Or maybe it's the decongestant regimen the nurse advised me to follow, to
prevent sinus infection. Or some combination thereof. So I made some good
progress on my playthrough of Phantasy Star 2, but today my brain feels like
overcooked porridge, and I still have that cold.

So obviously progress on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} stuff
hasn't been as fast as I would like today. I retract some of my initial
hostility towards {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} networking,
of course return messages are nontrivial in a connectionless (UDP) protocol,
and of course also there are some elegant idioms that make doing so relatively
straightforward.

I think I'm probably years away from being qualified to *actually* complain
about the SC language, but has that ever stopped a programmer before? Certainly
not.

Me for an early dinner followed by bed. Likely to work from home tomorrow,
although this being the last 4 working days of the year for me they are looking
action-packed.
