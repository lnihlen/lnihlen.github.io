For some reason the drive back from Palm Desert took only 7 hours, whereas the
drive out was almost 8. Even still, with nothing else going on today, the drive
back felt like it took a great deal of time.

I've been listening to the audio book versions of The Expanse book series,
finishing the third book on the way down and making good headway into the
fourth book on the way back up.

But it's good to be home, pulling back in to Santa Cruz, not having to rely
on my phone to navigate to a destination. We drove back into the pouring rain,
driving from the open desert skies to the closed, low-hanging clouds and then
heavy rainfall as we drove into the mountain.

Tomorrow I'm heading over the hill for an all-day
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} hackathon. I had hoped to make some
more progress but I think that would always be the case. It's pretty late, and
I'm pretty tired, but I might start trying to get the next iteration of the
clock scheduler going tonight.

Certainly looking forward to having a few days where work isn't foremost in my
mind, even if I am commuting over the hill. Hacking on SCLOrk code is a very
different experience than my typical workday, at least.
