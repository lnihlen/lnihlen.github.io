I was too sick to take advantage of (or even remember) this yesterday but
there's a release of Sega Genesis Classic games out for Switch. So this morning
I fired up the credit card and then got to downloading the games onto my
console.

I think some of these classic games I've bought easily 3 or 4 times, not
counting having purchased many of them at time of release. And it was super fun
to fire up Sonic the Hedgehog for a second, long enough to realize that I'm
going to have to practice quite a bit to get back to the state of flow and
fun that I remember from my college days.

But then I (re)-discovered Phantasy Star 2. It's super grindy, and I'm relying
on the helpful Internet game guides. But this is the kind of undemanding,
low-level entertainment that seems absolutely perfect for sitting on the couch,
dogs in my lap, with an achy sore throat and runny nose.

Didn't really have the energy today to get very far with the Supercollider work
for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, outside of firing up the IDE and
being reminded yet again that bidirectional communication in OSC doesn't seem
to come nearly as elegantly and easily as does unidirectional.

Also, it's fun reading the Utopia code, as there are a ton of Supercollider
programming idioms that I start to pick up, that's (hopefully) making my SC code
read a lot less like the weird ruby-C++ mashup I've been writing in so far.

I feel better today, maybe 65-70% recovered, so hopefully tomorrow continues
that trend.
