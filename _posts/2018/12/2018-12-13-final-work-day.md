Up early for a workout then the last day of back-to-back meetings of the day.
I've been recently worried that the pace I've been working at is not
sustainable. But for some reason knowing today that I was headed for a break
allowed the day to feel manageable, enjoyable even. It allowed me to fully
believe the idea that all I've been feeling recently that is negative is only
due to fatigue, and that in fact the burdens of my job will change their
weight when I'm no longer so weary.

I have a stressful job, and one of the challenges when I'm stressed is
remembering to stick to the routines and disciplines I have developed in order
to cope with that stress. That can be a downward spiral as I gain in stress,
so then lose discipline further, etc.

It can also be virtuous cycle. I'm hoping some time away will let me regain my
footing, getting healthy processes in place to sustain me, as well a wellspring
of recovered energy for the coming year.

Tomorrow we go to Palm Desert down South for the wedding of a friend on
Saturday. But then I'm back home, resting and recharging hopefully.
