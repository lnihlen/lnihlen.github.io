I'm definitely getting the other two network switches in the house LAN under
some kind of UPS protection. I spent a bit of time this morning trying to
diagnose my network problems. Turns out, the gigabit ethernet switches I have
needed power cycling. That's surprising to me, I mean I understand that switches
have firmware but this is the first time in memory that the switches have
had power and connectivity, with link lights a-blinkin', but weren't working.
I would guess that I'm lucky they weren't fried by whatever spurious electrical
fun was happening.

With the network back I was able to `ssh` in to my workstation and correct
the permissions on the `local.d` script to mount `/home`. Machine came right
back. I think part of this was a case of not trusting my own work maintaining
a Gentoo linux box over the network. There might be a lesson in that.

After fixing the ethernet cabling I had a bit of time so got back in to Red
Dead Redemption 2. I took an hour to not advance the plot one iota but rather
to head up Northwest from Valentine and tame that white Arabian horse hanging
out up there. Then I got attacked by a bear and barely survived. Made it back
to camp with my new horse, and donated the poor quality bear pelt to the
camp stores. Good times.

Hilary has been taking voice lessons at a local music school, and they had their
bi-annual recital in Scotts Valley today. So it was off to listen to her perform
a Disney song, accompanied by her music teacher on piano. Recitals are fun
because of the shared experience of supporting folks through their anxiety
around performing. Plus you get to hear a bunch of people practicing
performance, which can be pretty cool. There was a kid who played the piano
to Tequila:

Asking for audience participation to sing the "lyrics." It was a risk but that
kid had some serious charisma so had the whole audience singing along.

When {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} plays anywhere in Santa Cruz
we typically stop at Saturn for a pre-gig dinner. Hilary chose to maintain that
tradition, which was great, and we were joined by Grawer and Ariya, who had
come over the hill to see Hil perform. So blueberry pancakes and
{% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} chicken tenders for all!
