I had a bit of time today to work on setting up the studio, enough so that I
could get the computer going and make some noise with the modular synth gear
I have plus {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}.

Then it was time to dig in to the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
homework. I made my first Quark repository, for the
[SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat) program. One of the things
I had noticed was that I was building up increasingly large comment blocks
at the top of each object, so learning the syntax of the Supercollider help
files felt like a natural improvement, as well as a nice way to start combing
over this code to assess what remains to be finished.

I'm really impressed by the way the IDE has been built to expedite Quark
development. Like many avenues of Supercollider, I'm consistently surprised and
delighted by the careful thought that has been given to making the language and
supporting tooling useful and productive.

Turns out, the IDE has syntax highlighting for `schelp` files as well as the
normal SC documents, plus easy regeneration of the output help in the built-in
window. Thanks to the easy built-in distribution system of Quarks, when I'm
ready to share an early revision of the chat program with Bruno, the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} conductor, all I have to do is send
him the URL for the Quark and he can install and configure it all in a single
line of code.

While I have a ton of work left to get to where I want to be by the end of the
break, it's super cool and exciting to be learning about this new aspect of
Supercollider.
