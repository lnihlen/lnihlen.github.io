These vacation days feel short, partly I think because I tend to pack them full
of various fun activities like cooking and hacking, and partly because Hil and
I both sleep in and go to bed at a reasonable hour, so hour waking hours tend
to run just slightly over 12 per day.

All that aside, today was about trying to make some more progress on the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} homework, while also cooking up a mess
of {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} food. Perfect for what turned out to
be a really rainy day, off and on.

On the SCLOrk front I made some small headway on the UI for SCLOrkChat,
basically by (once again) abandoning my original approach to chat message view
layout and working pout a hard-coded solution. With only a week left I'm hoping
I'll have a few days soon to knuckle down hard on this and make some serious
headway.

There were several cooking experiments on tap for today. The first was to make
an attempt at veganizing a classic cranberry pie recipe passed down from my mom.
She typically makes it every Christmas. This turned out pretty well, probably
better than my first vegan pie attempt from Thanksgiving. Instead of a flax egg
substitute I used the Bob's Red Mill egg substitute. I might have used too much,
really, because instead of taking 2 days to set in the fridge this pie has what
feels like a really stiff gelatinous texture. I also found it a bit sweet
compared to my memory of the pie but Hil said less sugar might make it too tart.

I also tried my hand at vegan Swedish meatballs, using the new (to me) protein
Soy Curls. I doubled up the recipe, probably a memory of Christmases past with
my mom, who always prepared a great abundance of food, including these
meatballs. I think if I had rolled them smaller they would have browned a little
more evenly, but with a double recipe I didn't have the requisite patience to
roll all of that up into tiny tablespoon-size balls.

But all in all, we were able to enjoy a decent Christmas Eve feast, as well as
exchange our traditional small gift, in anticipation of a few larger presents
tomorrow.

We don't do the religious thing at all but for those who celebrate in any form
or another, merry Christmas.
