I was able to boot the copied images, so spent some time this evening bringing
up each board in the cluster, setting the hostname and noting the MAC address
for the DHCP server, and then installing the board in the array. Once the IP
addresses are correct my plan is to get ssh certificates installed for login
without password authentication and then have a go and having all 9 Pi boards
generate tone.

I think I'm starting to get a cold. There's a lot of folks out sick at work, or
who have come in to work sick, and I started feeling a little tickle in the back
of my throat, as well as feeling pretty worn down, during the late afternoon
early evening time frame.

So I might end up calling in sick to work tomorrow, which isn't a great day to
do so. But when is there ever a great day to call in sick?
