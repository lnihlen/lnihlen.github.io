Spent a sort of frustrating, unproductive day up on Santa Clara University
campus working on {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code. Unfortunately
I ran against a bug in my network timing code pretty hard for most of the day.
Then my laptop crashed in a creative and interesting way, requiring me to
literally unplug it and let the battery run down to empty in order to recover
it. Since it was only about 15 minutes until the end of the hack session that
kind of just put the cherry on the top of the poo pile so I packed it up.

The problem I'm encountering when trying to make my own clock is that the items
that I am scheduling, when it's time to have them execute, I'm supposed to call
the `awake` method, but this method typically yields a value with the `^`
operator. I'm running my tasks on the `SystemClock` and so the yield is
treated like an argument to `SystemClock` asking for a reschedule there instead
of on my clock. I don't know how to intercept those values, and can't seem to
find any reason why the code in `Clock.sc` works and my code doesn't.

The less awesome (but perhaps honestly better) solution is to kind of follow
the `BeaconClock` pattern by inheriting from `TempoClock` and then periodically
adjusting the `beats` value on the parent object to reflect the remote clock.

We had a work holiday party for just the Movies team, and it was cool to bring
+1s so Hilary drove over the hill and met me there. It was a good reminder of
the fact that I genuinely like everyone on my current team. Super chill,
friendly party. We left early because that's how I roll at parties but I left
feeling lucky to work with so many excellent people.
