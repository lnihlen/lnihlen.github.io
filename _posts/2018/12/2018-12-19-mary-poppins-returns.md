First day off since starting vacation last Friday that felt like a real day off.
I spent some time in the gym, leisurely working through through an hour workout
in around 80 minutes. To be fair, I was assembling a sled while working out,
which was an early Christmas gift from Hilary. We've been missing sled workouts
since we moved from the gym to my garage, so I was so excited to see the sled
in the back of Hilary's car I just had to get it "unwrapped" and constructed.

Hilary had volunteered to sub a Tween Yoga class over at Luma today so I sat
in the coffee shop across the street and got some additional work done on the
various {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} projects I'm hacking away on.

Once the class was done it was off to Saturn for a quick bite and then we had
7pm tickets for Mary Poppins Returns, a movie that Hilary has been anticipating
for well over a year.

Besides loving the first film a great deal, Hilary's grandfather was
[Peter Ellenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ellenshaw), who shared an
Oscar for visual effects for the original Mary Poppins movie. The new movie's
opening credits roll across images of matte paintings that Peter made for the
original movie. Peter is also acknowledged in the credits along with an
additional thank you to the Ellenshaw family.

So it was an emotional viewing experience for us both, because it's a powerful
movie, but I think that for Hilary there was the additional pleasure of seeing
her grandfather's work honored and built upon. Plus Lin-Manuel Miranda and
Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep and Angela Lansbury, mind-bending visual effects, and
a Leery Dance that combines like, 20 different forms of modern entertainment.

It was remarkable.
