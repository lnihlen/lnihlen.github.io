Slept late, which I almost never do at home, grabbed some oatmeal from room
service (the ubiquitous {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} breakfast
option). We had a few hours to kill before our flight so I did a Maps
search for any local {% include tag_link.html tag="modular" %} synth stores.

Portland has an embarrassment of riches in that it has two great stores,
[Control Voltage](http://controlvoltage.net/) and
[Modular 8](http://modular8.com). Compare to the Bay Area, which has one that
I know of, and Los Angeles which only one as well. In terms of synth stores
per capita
Portland is crushing it!

Both were within a short drive of the hotel, and on
the way to the airport, but in the interest of time (and to spare some heat on
my credit card) I chose the one that was closer, Control Voltage. They have an
extensive online store but I wasn't sure about the retail presence. When I've
visited [Analogue Haven](http://analoguehaven.com) in LA before I've called or
emailed ahead to check that
they are open, and it's been hit-or-miss depending on their availability.
But the friendly person on the phone at Control Voltage told me that they were
a "full-on brick and mortar" store and that they would be there until 8.

I liked the setup of the store, they had
many different racks set up, each with a headphone amp of some kind or another
in the rack, and patch cables laying about so you could patch up a demo for
yourself and get a feel for the different options and capabilities of the
modules on display.

Had a great time demoing out a few different modules. I've been having some
interesting sounds coming out of resonant filters, and resonators in general,
both in {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} and in my
{% include tag_link.html tag="modular" %} setup, so I was excited to see what
they might have along those lines.

I'm also always looking for oscillators with more interesting harmonic
character, and the CV folks helpfully pointed me to the
[Make Noise tELHARMONIC](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/telharmonic),
first starting as a source for the filters but I noticed it had a lot of
interesting tones, so picking one up was an easy call.

Using the tELHARMONIC as my source I then ran it into the
[WMD Aperture](https://wmdevices.com/products/aperture), another CV staff pick.
I got some of the richest feedback tones I've heard in a modular setup, so that
became a quick must-have.

I've only seen the
[4ms Spectral Multiband Resonator](https://4mscompany.com/smr.php)
on YouTube videos so I was super stoked to get a chance to try one in person,
it's every bit the awesome module it seems to be. 4ms has some of the best
noisy modules around, so no surprise that the SMR is super capable.

Also in the demo rack I was delighted to find the
[Intellijel Springray II](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/springray-2/),
a spring reverb module with attachable external spring tank. A chance to try
this in person, running some of the tELHARMONIC sounds through it, made it an
obvious choice to pick up.

Time for a quick bite, stepping out of Control Voltage I looked on Maps again
for vegan food, of course there were at least 4 restaurants within a block of
the store, so we hiked across the street for food, then on to the airport and
made our way home.

I can't wait to rack those modules up!
