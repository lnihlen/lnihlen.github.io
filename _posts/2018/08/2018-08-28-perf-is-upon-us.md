On the bright side, I'm typing this into a shiny new gVim terminal window on the
workstation. Plasma emerge finished some time over night, had a few quick config
motions to go through, and I had a shiny new window manager, display manager,
Chrome web browser with desktop notifications enabled, blah blah blah. You
don't take anything for granted when you're building it all from source.

Zapped the Zero in to work and then.. and then.. it's all kind of a blur after
that. Twice a year, in the spring and fall, Google does a performance review
cycle. For managers this is a crucial time of the year for helping to advance
the careers of the people on your team, and re-affirming your commitment to that
spectrum of responsibilities as a coach, mentor, advocate, and (career)
counselor.

e-Paperwork is due for all reports. Folks going up for promotion need a great
deal more special attention, to make sure the argument for promotion is prepared
properly and shepherded through the process.

This is, of course, all *in addition* to my usual responsibilities, and the
extra effort I'm putting in to hiring right now. It's tough to have a day of
back-to-back meetings, feel like you worked your ass and hit more than you
missed, and when the day is done realize you probably have at least 4 more
hours of work you could do just to get caught up.

In any event I got a chance to kick off the install of a few of the
supercollider build dependencies, and then it was time for bed. Tomorrow's
looking no better for that.
