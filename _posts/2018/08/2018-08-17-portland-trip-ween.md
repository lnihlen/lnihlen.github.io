Took the day off of work today and headed up to the PDX for a chance to catch
[Ween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ween) live at
[McMenamins](https://edgefieldconcerts.com/). This is a band I've been listening
to since high school in the early 1990s. I remember a few years back reading
that one of the members had left, citing ongoing issues with drug abuse, which
for Ween isn't particularly surprising. The band announced they were
essentially done, because to continue with only half of the Gene and Dean team
was not realistic.

I thought I had missed my chance. It's tough for me to get over all of the
diverse anxieties I might encounter in choosing to see live music, but Ween has
had a special place in my heart. I've followed them in, through, and finally
out of my own addiction journey. They've always impressed me with their musical
sensibility, their careful listening and internalization of a broad array of
genres, the individual weird twist on their songwriting, and their outstanding
musicianship.

The chance to see them, after having thought I had missed it forever, was a
real treat. Kudos to Hilary for nudging me to get off my ass and book the show,
booking the flights, rental car, and hotel, and going with me to support what
was a pretty incredible show.

Another treat about Portland is the awesome array of
{% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} food. We got in
before lunch, so took the opportunity to grab some pizza downtown at Sizzle
Pie. We don't get pizza very often as there are so few places in the bay area
that have palatable vegan options so this was a great treat.

Hil noticed an interesting used bookstore across the street, so we popped over
to [Powell's](http://www.powells.com/). What a neat store! Hil got a book by
Issa Rae and I grabbed a title from a neat section called Psychedelic Lit.

After checking in at the hotel we made the short drive out to McMenamins
and grabbed a seat on the lawn. Ween played for about 2 hours. They served
a good mix of old and new material, including an encore of
[Ocean Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs926AIL-ck) on mandolin. I noticed
they lavished a lot of attention on The Mollusk album. I particularly enjoyed
[Buckingham Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBDluMsYN4c). The band
sounded great.

Show got out shortly after 9, we were back in the hotel by 10 pm. No hassle.
Time well spent.
