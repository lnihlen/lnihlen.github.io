Long work week doesn't describe it by half. And I find the apocalyptic smoke
hanging over the bay during my commute (and noticeable even indoors in the
valley) very reminiscent of my recent re-read of
[Dhalgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhalgren).

The next film in our Lynda Thompson project is
[Dave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_%28film%29), which actually ain't half
bad. It's fun to see Ving Rhames with hair.

Given the upcoming SCLOrk rehearsal on Monday I'm needing to spend some time
this weekend on making sure that at least the chat app is working correctly,
and to fix the NFS mounting for the SCLOrk laptops.

But otherwise, I'm aiming for a relatively low cognitive load this weekend, and
plenty of sleep.
