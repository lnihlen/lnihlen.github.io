Got out of work a bit early to pick up some cabling from
[Starving Musician](https://starvingmusician.com/cart/), then headed over to
Santa Clara for the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal. We
started up the chat program I had written, and got some good mileage out of
that, which was good to see. Also good to see a couple of bugs crop up in the
code, well not good, but good to see it get enough of a proper exercise that it
uncovered some bugs.

The nfs file share stuff worked without drama too, and for some reason, although
not due to any configuration changes on my part, the Internet connection sharing
worked this time, so that was a plus.

Last step was to get the multitrack recording stuff working. I had spent some
time last night trying to get the Linux server to do the recording, to no
avail, so I had to break out the MacBook and get the recording on that. But that
seemed to work ok as well too, so three for three (ish).

We jammed on two different pieces, then it was time to wrap it up. Looking
forward to trimming down the recording to the pieces, mixing them to stereo,
and listening back.

Then it was home late and straight to bed, got an early morning and back at it.
Plus, another {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} gig on Wednesday
night.
