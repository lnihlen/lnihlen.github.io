Rushed home from work a bit early today to pick up Hil and head over to
my first attendance of the monthly meeting of the
[Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/santacruznewtech/). The
theme of the night was Women in Tech, which seemed particularly relevant in
light of [recent](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html)
[events](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html).

Overall I was glad I attended. There were some good talks, I picked up a copy of
[Nevertheless, She Persisted](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Pratima_Rao_Gluckman_Nevertheless_She_Persisted),
signed by the author Pratima no less, who gave a good talk on the subject.

I had a low-key recruiting goals in mind, nothing overt but I did write that I
was hiring on my nametag, and talked to a few people. I was more encouraged by
the chance to just be a part of the Santa Cruz tech community, in some small
way, although I do work "over the hill," as it is commonly said.

Will definitely try to attend the next meetup in December.
