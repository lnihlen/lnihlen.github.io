"Half man, half shark, equals one complete gentleman." Quote of the movie,
[Cabin Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_Boy), another Lynda Thompson
movie project and so on our watch list for the night. That's an odd one, to say
the least. High points are Russ Tamblyn (Dr. Jacobi from Twin Peaks) appearing
as the aforementioned halfsharkalligatorhalfman, gutpunching a giant in a fight
with a giant dressed as a housewares salesman. Wondering if the sample from
that song is taken from this movie.

Next up is White Fang 2. We're going in blind. Hil had seen Cabin Boy before, so
could at least warn me about the upcoming weirdness. Not sure how one would have
prepared for that.

Looking at a little stretch of time off after today. We'll see what I catch a
mood for, maybe some work on {% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} or maybe
make some progress on scintillator. First thing would probably be to finish
the mixdown of the last {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal I was
working on earlier.
