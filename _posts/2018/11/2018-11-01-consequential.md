My hope for this blog has been that it would be about my life outside of work.
I'm not a representative of Google, for one, but more importantly I wanted to
have an artifact about my life that would indicate to all (including myself)
that I haven't been completely *consumed* by my job at Google, that I do indeed
have a life outside of the company.

I think the realization I've had working on this blog is that my life outside
of work is both greater and lesser than I had thought. It's greater in that
I can see that there's much richness and color in my life outside of work.
It's lesser in that I've realized how much of my daily life is consumed by work,
and also how much of my thoughts are as well. I spend a lot of my time and
energy at Google, I can easily say that my career there represents my life's
work in a very real fashion.

Today is one of those days in which I can honestly say that there's very little
of consequence to say about my life outside of work. And that's OK, that's where
the balance has settled. That's where it'll have to settle, as a consequence of
the career and workplace I have chosen.
