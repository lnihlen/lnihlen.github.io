Had my weekly meeting with my manager and he's bringing up some concerns around
my level of fatigue. Yeah, been burning it pretty hard right now, focused on
recruiting while keeping the team going.

Thinking of taking some time off later in December, once things start winding
down for the winter break. Maybe also for the time around Thanksgiving, but
there's actually a lot scheduled for that week.

The problem with being a manager is that there's never really a "good" time to
take off, there's always something going on at work that seems to require me
to be in the office and available.

Like I honestly would call in "sick" tomorrow, with just exhaustion being the
problem, and possibly work from home, but I have at least two meetings, one
with external people, tomorrow that I need to attend in person.

So yeah, I could see why he was saying it was OK to maybe consider throttling
back a little bit. And I will, in maybe like 3-5 more weeks.
