I'm an avid Google News reader, and for the last couple of weeks I've noticed
that many of the personalized "headlines" have been about Black Friday deals.
The opportunity to buy an expensive laptop for slightly less than the usual
exorbitant price to me doesn't necessarily qualify as headline news. So that, in
combination with the constant all-day rain, made it easy for me to celebrate Buy
Nothing Day on this Friday after Thanksgiving.

So, I think today was the first actual vacation day that I've had since I
started the week off. I took a nap on the couch with Hilary, the dogs, and our
cat. Then it was time to eat leftover pie, not just for lunch but also for
dessert. I made a bit more headway on Red Ded Redemption II, finally getting to
the end of the winter missions and to where the whole "open world" well, opens
up.

So yeah, an actual day off. Not so bad at all.
