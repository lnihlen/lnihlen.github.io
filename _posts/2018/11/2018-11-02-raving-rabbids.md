So I installed Red Dead Redemption 2 on my PS4, but the game that's actually
been taking up my time, since my camping trip last weekend, is
[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Kingdom_Battle),
which really is something. I enjoy the XCom-like tactical gameplay. I also
am a backer of the Phoenix Point thing but I'm not playing any of the backer
builds, as I'd rather wait until its released and play the finished product.

I appreciate that the Kingdom Battle game is made for short play sessions on
the Switch, because I can dip in on it and play a bit, then dip out, whenever
I want. It was great to take the Switch on the camping trip, and it's also nice
to plug it in to the living room TV and play there, and then nice when Hilary
wants to watch a show I can just pull the Switch back out and keep playing.

I think the tl;dr here is I'm completely fried at the moment, the events of the
week have left me in a state. Time to fall back on what has worked for me for
decades, carbs and video games.
