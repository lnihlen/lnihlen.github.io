SCLork rehearsal tonight was super fun. We played through the two pieces we've
been working on, and another piece that I've seen on the short promotional
videos for SCLork. It uses a John Cage quote about noise and music, with each
performer contributing a sentence or two to the overall quote. Each character
typed by a performer results in audio playback of a sample of prepared piano
Bruno collected. The conductor controls the projection of the sentences on the
screen, including fade out time of the individual letters of the sentences as
typed by individual performers. There's one additional role, a single performer
who can insert random letters into the projection, which also plays random notes
on their individual loudspeaker.

There was lots of discussion about possible new pieces based on the `Utopia`
tech. At minimum, I've made a plan to develop a local chat windowing utility,
to avoid having to connect to the Internet during live performances where the
laptops may have no Internet connectivity.

We're also starting to prepare for a piece about copyright, in which we will
build a sample archive from different time periods, then perform using those
different times. Early phases for that, we're all still brainstorming about
possible ideas, but it's exciting to think about.

Also lots of discussions around visualizations, and what we might be able to
construct. Makes me want to spend some time sprinting on Scintillator, the
visual server idea I had for {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}.

It's good, I guess, that I leave the rehearsal with a lot more ideas about what
I could possibly implement than I have time to implement them in, by far.
