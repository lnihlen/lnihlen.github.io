So Hilary has headed down to LA for a week (ish) for an Accessible Yoga training
session. I'm staying up here to go to work and keep things under (relative)
control at the house.

I had been hoping for a burst of personal productivity during this time but
honestly the time I get to spend with Hilary during the work week is pretty
minimal, we try to take dinner together every night, plus some other short
times. Furthermore that time is recuperative, I enjoy spending the time with
her, so between picking up her (admittedly greater) division of labor on the
animal care, and the drag from being denied the pleasure of her company, I
actually think it's a net negative in terms of creative output.

I've been following the new season of Samurai Jack and it's just incredible. I'm
not used to watching something on live TV where you only get one episode a week.
I have all the old seasons on Google Play. So at least Jack can keep me company
on these quiet nights.
