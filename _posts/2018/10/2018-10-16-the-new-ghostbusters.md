One of the funnest parts of working for Play Movies & TV is that I end up
renting or buying a lot of movies. Having polished off our Dwayne Johnson
project (and not a minute too soon, eeeeccch), Hilary and I have decided to
embark on a [Lynda Thompson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0501505/) filmography
project. Lynda is Hilary's awesome aunt, so my awesome aunt in-law.

We started on the original Tron the other night, and tonight we were scheduled
to watch Ghostbusters. But we decided to opt for the new one, after getting the
bundle of all three.

We had seen it in theaters when it opened, both because it looked funny and also
to support the film in the light of the weird sexist backlash that it unfairly
received. I remember enjoying it in the theaters, but watching it at home was a
real treat. Maybe it's that the context has shifted a bit from the release, but
the movie was side-splittingly funny at times. It's an underrated hit, I think.

We'll get back to Project LT soon, although with Hil in Pennsylvania for a while
it might be a minute.
