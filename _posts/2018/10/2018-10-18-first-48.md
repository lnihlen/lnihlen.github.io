Dinner with a former colleague from Daydream after work, so got home late. Hilary
got on a plane this morning at 6 AM, headed to Pennsylvania for 12 days.
Thursday nights are homework nights, just finished that up and now I'm pretty
spent. No time tonight really for anything else, really.

I have TV shows I put on when Hilary is out of town. It used to be Forged in
Fire but I think I've watched all of those. Most recently I got a season of
The First 48 on Google Play. Most interesting are the negotiations, the cops
trying to get people to divulge information while they are afraid and under
extreme duress. It's definitely a guilty pleasure.
