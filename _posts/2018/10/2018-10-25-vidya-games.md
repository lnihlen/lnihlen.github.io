There have been times in my life where I have been completely consumed by
video games. I can also remember those times as times where I was really
struggling with depression and anxiety. I think a less self-judgemental way of
saying this is that video games have helped me get through some of the hardest
and darkest times in my life.

The original Legend of Zelda, when I was the new 5th grader kid in a new school
in a new city after my mom had entered into an abusive relationship. I would
play it over all other things in my life, which caused serious distress with
my mom and my new other mom. I was often grounded from it as a result, it was I
think the only thing my parents could take away from me at the time that would
in any way make my life shittier. Well, outside of things like food and shelter,
but you know. I remember I would study the instruction manual at night, looking
at the illustrations, thinking of playing, re-reading the text for clues.

I remember also the original Metroid giving me a lot of joy, but can't for the
life of me recall when or where I played it for the first time. I just remember
that being another big deal of a game, along with
[3D WorldRunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3-D_Battles_of_WorldRunner):

I remember my mom's partner found the soundtrack to that one particularly
annoying. Yes, the boss fights are a obvious knockoff of Space Harrier, done
less well. But the jumping mechanic is surprisingly fun.

High school had me getting in to PC games, as I started spending a lot of time
on the computer, beginning what would become a lifelong trend. I also got a job
in a used computer software store (hah!) which had me exploring things like
dearly wishing I had an Amiga 500 and picking up a used copy of Microsoft Macro
Assembler. I skipped Super Nintendo, concentrating my very limited funds on
music instruments, marijuana, and food at the
[Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Restaurant). Thing is, I
can remember playing a lot of video games during this time but no particular
special game.

College had probably one of my deepest video game relationships with XCom 2.
I can still play that game for hours, and [Open XCom](https://openxcom.org/)
has sucked up plenty of my time, along with the rebooted games by Firaxis,
which I have enjoyed, despite their missing much of the open-ended creativity
that I found so compelling in the original games.

I've had a few games that I played with friends, Morrowind and Grand Theft Auto,
but mostly gaming has been a solitary pleasure for me. Half Life and Half Life
2, Fallout 3 and 4, Diablo 2, Mass Effect 1 and 2, have all gotten 100+ hours
of my time. World of Warcraft I am sure caused the reduction of some grades in
graduate school, and I had to hang up on Eve Online, to have any hope for a
normal life.

Dwarf Fortress deserves its own blog post. Suffice to say the cake toppers at
my wedding were ASCII art dwarf graphics, color coded for metalworker and
farmer.

I'll go through jags, sometimes months long, where what I want to do with my
free time almost entirely is play video games. Sooner or later, however, I
either start to feel that the waste of time is becoming criminal, or I get
bored, or both.

The joy of video games, I think, and the problem with video games for me is
that they are wrapped around themselves. The most common, and usually most
interesting reward for being good at video games is *more video games.* This
is great when the amount of self-hatred I'm feeling is so crippling that I
am freaking out over having almost made a mistake in a video game, because
the mistakes, just like the successes, are almost entirely inconsequential in
real life.

But that's also the problem with video games. On my worst, most unproductive
day of dicking around with {% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} or
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} I will at least have *learned*
something, stepped in some tiny way outside of my comfort zone and dared to
make some kind of creative impact on the world, however miniscule and
insignificant. And that is wonderful.

I'd like to develop some means to distinguish when I'm not gaming out of some
antiquated moral sensibility about the suitability of various forms of
entertainment ("why can't you just read a book?") from times when I'm not gaming
because I choose to reserve time for creative pursuits, or from times when I'm
using it as a form of self care (and there might be a more suitable one like
psychotherapy or exercise), and from when playing a game might give me a
genuine feeling of joy.

All of this is a long rumination on Red Dead Redemption 2. The Guardian review
that I read this morning makes me feel like this might be something special.
Perhaps, once some of the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code is
more stable, during that week of downtime between Christmas and New Years, there
could be some time for that in my life.
