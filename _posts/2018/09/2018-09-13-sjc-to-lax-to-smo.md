After a late night preparing for first round of performance review meetings
this morning, and then rising early for said meetings, I took the afternoon off
to fly with Hilary from San Jose Airport to LAX. We had been planning on driving
down four our annual Hilary Birthday Pilgrimage to Disneyland, but with my work
trip to Chicago next week it seemed flying would be more prudent.

I have anxiety dreams about missing flights so we arrived pretty early. Got
a chance to work on {% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} during the wait,
namely on the refactor to the `Spec` object to use `Codon` language instead of
raw bytecode. I ended up in a place where it makes sense for a `Spec` to contain
more than one `Codon`, which kind of bucked my original concept about how
Sequencing was going to happen. While I was mulling that over I went and
deprecated a bunch of the old serialization code that was now broken due to
the change. I was getting a bit bummed about working on having to refactor
that and then decided I would wait until I had some of the core pieces a bit
further along. And then it was time to board.

Because of the driving plan we're spending the night in Santa Monica. We were
able to grab dinner at an old hangout of Hilary's, Swingers. I appreciate a
restaurant that I can still eat at even after my transition from omni to
{% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %}. And despite my best intentions to eat
as healthfully as possible, I still love diners. So you know I'm down with a
place that serves both quinoa bowls with black beans and straight up old-school
cheeseburgers.

Now back in the hotel. The only thing on the agenda tomorrow is travel down to
Anaheim, so looking forward to what should be a pretty chill day in SMO. Looking
forward to laying down my head in the magic kingdom.
