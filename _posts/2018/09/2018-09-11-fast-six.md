Perf is upon us still, will be for the next month(ish), so tonight was another
night of grinding through paperwork.

But before that, Hil noticed that it was Ethiopian New Year so we had to go
celebrate it at our favorite Ethiopian spot
[Zeni](http://zeniethiopianrestaurant.com/), which I think we've eaten at
probably 3 out of the last 7 days. As always the food was delicious, vegan,
and satisfying.

Then home for the (e)-paperwork and advance our Dwayne Johnson filmography
project with tonight's selection,
[Fast & Furious 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious_6). My
favorite is when Dom jumps out of a moving car to catch his old flame Letty,
just ejected from a car being destroyed by a tank, and land them both on
top of yet another moving car, thus avoiding plummeting off of a bridge. The
CG has aged sorta well.

Good times.
