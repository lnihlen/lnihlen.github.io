We slept in, probably still pretty exhausted from yesterday's activities. The
goal of the second day of our traditional trip to Disneyland in Anaheim is to
visit California Adventure. After a hot morning on our very first trip to
California Adventure we wanted to spend the afternoon relaxing by the resort
pool. Hil noticed some shaded spots with seating, but when we enquired of the
staff we learned that the cabanas are reserved weeks in advance. So, note for
next time. We've rented a cabana every visit sense and it really is a great way
to rest and recover from the heat and noise of the parks.

I think because Hilary didn't visit the park as a child our experience of
California Adventure is much the same - far less shade then Disneyland, fewer
characters we can relate to (although that is changing with Pixar Pier), but
still a good time overall. It is sensible that we spend the lion's share of our
time and energy on Disneyland.

We rode the Little Mermaid attraction, which is a yearly tradition for us.
The ride was paused for a moment, while we were waiting in line. I watched a
adult man and a little girl, presumably his daughter, sitting patiently in the
shell-shaped cart. He had a faraway look in his eyes. I was struck by the
distinct impression that the ride was just a giant machine, the
*mechanicalness* of it, this machine whose sole purpose is to create human joy.

We're all looking for that fix, that moment on the ride where you feel some
resonance, some connection to something inside of yourself that the story
honors. For me it's the room with the aquatic band. I don't understand it, I
didn't grow up with Disney, and in fact the culture of my family has some
antagonism toward the brand. It's anti-feminist and politically regressive.
Disney's record on race is spotty at the most generous interpretation.

But here we are. And don't get me wrong, this isn't some epic 3-day service to
Hilary alone. I genuinely enjoy myself here.

After the Mermaid ride we took a few photos and walked around various places,
looking for Coco merch. By then it was time for the Cabana reservation so we
headed back and changed.

If you have the means I highly recommend the cabana. It's a high point of the
entire trip for me. Poolside service, free WiFi, and a fruit plate. We took
a dip in the pool and hot tub, Hil got in a nap, I
[finished a draft](https://github.com/lnihlen/vcsmc/commit/9efe284bae581c1698ebfb0e38ee7db275fcc41b)
of the Translation (formerly sequencing, name corrected) stuff on
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %}. Then it was time to wash off the
chlorine, head to dinner, and get in line for another "baby rave," as we
affectionately call the after-dark light shows.

We found a new place to try, Carthay Circle, and not only were they happy to
accommodate me with an off-menu vegan pasta concoction, which was delicious,
they let us hang out on the balcony for the passing Paint the Night
glow-in-the-dark parade. Satisfied, we headed back to the room.

Setting the alarm for 5 am tomorrow to catch a plane to Chicago.
