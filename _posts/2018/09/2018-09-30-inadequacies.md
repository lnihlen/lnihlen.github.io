I read
[an Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/opinion/sunday/in-praise-of-mediocrity.html)
in the New York Times yesterday about not letting the tyranny of the relentless
pursuit of perfection ruin the enjoyment of a hobby pursued only for pleasure.

I read this at a time where, despite that article being so full of good
intentions, I'm more likely to start beating myself up for not having a healthy
perspective about my various hobbies than I am going to give myself any kind of
break in that regard.

*This should be easy* is something I think about so many things that I can
observe, at least for me, are objectively not. And I can step outside of myself
and enumerate so much of the evidence that indicates, to me, that I'm under
strain:

  * faltering discipline in both exercise and healthy eating
  * tendency to eat to excess, particularly of carbs and fatty foods
  * crushing self-doubt in all social and professional interactions
  * micro-examination of every such interaction after the fact, and finding
    fault in my every word or email phrase
  * wistful thinking about the good ol' (bad) days of all-day-erry-day
    wake-and-bake pot smoking
  * avoidance of any positive social interaction
  * decreased concentration and efficiency at work and on creative projects
  * difficulty both in falling asleep and then waking up
  * difficulty getting out of bed once awake

There's a vicious cycle here because work and having some kind of sense
of control over my weight/exercise/eating spectrum are primary sources of my
self-esteem, so as I start to either experience (or perceive) there being some
issue in some/all of these that only brings up more self-doubt/self-hatred,
which increases my stress level, which bring out the above symptoms more, wash
rinse repeat.

Right now it's just completely out of control. I've spent the morning reacting
to some last-minute feedback on a work deadline from a well-meaning colleague
that has me cringing with shame when imagining the meeting we will have on
Thursday to discuss this work, and certain that they have judged me to be a
complete nincompoop, having not only lost their support for my next promotion
attempt but likely ensuring they will now go out of their way to impede my
career because *it's the right thing to do*. Times like these, mortal enemies
of mine seem far more rational and commonplace than anyone who might be
considered a friend.

I'm also well aware of what's going on in the world right now and how lucky I
am on so many levels, how much privilege that I enjoy on a daily basis,
probably whole swaths of privilege that I'm even ignorant of. So if you, dear
reader, wrinkle your nose in disgust at this all I can say is *of course*, and
I can't blame you.

When I'm like this self care can be difficult to justify, I'd first have to
decide that I deserve self care in the first place.

I wish I had some light at the end of the tunnel to offer but at the moment I'm
not seeing one. Maybe some sleep, or some exercise, or some other experience
in my day-to-day will be unexpectedly fulfilling. I don't know normally how
I snap out of these things, actually that's why I don't know - I never *snap*
out of it. It's more like a gradual thaw, such that there will come a day,
some time away from now, where I will realize that I have forgotten to feel like
a piece of shit all the time and just feel ok.

It often remember that while riding my motorcycle, or looking at sunlight on
trees, so since it's Autumn maybe both are more likely than not to happen soon.
