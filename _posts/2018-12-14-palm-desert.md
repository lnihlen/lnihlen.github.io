We did get to sleep in a bit, but after we got up it was time for a long day of
driving to make it down to Palm Desert. Tomorrow we're going to a wedding for
one of Hilary's friends. I of course again forgot to bring the power supply for
this laptop so will be sparing with the postings. I hadn't really planned on
having much time for either blogging or hacking, so it's not a total loss.

I would say this is one difference from moving from the Apple world to the
boutique Linux laptop world is that the power supplies become bigger, uglier,
and far less commonly available. I can remember easily a few different occasions
where I've been able to scrounge up a new power supply for my old Apple laptops,
including once when honeymooning in Ecuador where we were able to take a taxi
to a mall in Quito that had an off-brand Apple products store with power
supplies in stock. Not so much with the System 76 laptops.

This is particularly annoying considering that the Oryx Pro has USB-C ports,
but does not charge with them. So while I do carry a USB-C charger, which can
charge my Nintendo Switch as well as my Pixel 3 XL, I continually forget that
I also need to bring this giant charging brick with a barrel connector if I
want unrestricted use of my laptop on a trip.
