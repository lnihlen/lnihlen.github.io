My sense this past weekend was that if there were tasks I wanted to complete
before leaving for camping this coming Saturday, I had better complete them
then. I know it's only Tuesday but already I am feeling that my intuition
around timing was correct.

It occurred to me that this is my first time solo camping ever, as well as my
first time really camping in the pop-up camper. I really have no solid idea what
I want to do with the time. I'm bringing hiking shoes, a couple of books to read
on print and also downloaded, some facilities for making music, my laptop, a set
of binoculars, and a canteen. I might go on a longer hike, or I might decide to
sleep all day, or I may get inspired and spend all day and night hacking on
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} or
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. I'm not sure at all how I'll want to
spend my time.

I am bringing a few different facilities for charging the electric stuff. And
wrapping up the Twin Peaks series, probably tonight, through which electricity
runs (hah) as a theme. It's interesting to consider my dependency on electricity
in the context of camping. I'll have a solar and gasoline generator on hand,
an extra solar panel for the camper, extra gasoline for the generator, a truck
(hopefully) full of diesel, and diverse means and ways to convert electricity
to any of the forms that might be useful to power the diverse devices I'm
bringing. Honestly I'm not sure if I'm trying to go away from it all and unplug,
because while LTE coverage may not be a certainty there it looks like I'll have
plenty of screens.

Typing out that last paragraph I am aware of how ridiculous this looks to read.
Working in Silicon Valley I find I'm surrounded constantly by a constellation
of different devices, all of them with Internet connectivity. When I vacation
I'm not really any different these days. On our trip through Ireland and England
Hilary and I both had our phones activated for world travel. I brought my
personal laptop and my work laptop (although maintained a pretty good rule about
not opening that, it was only for emergencies), a tablet which also had LTE
connectivity, and my Nintendo Switch. And while there were plenty of times
when I was interacting with none of these devices, I also really enjoyed a lot
of time unwinding by surfing the web or hacking on
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} stuff.

Point being, I can unwind just fine with a laptop on my lap, and I'm not too
sure if I'd be happier camping device-free than I would be with the many screens
I'll be packing. I can always leave things packed away in my backpack if I do
decide to go full unplug. And I am being careful to set expectations around
not being able to communicate during this trip. I am still planning on blogging,
but may reserve the right to post retroactively if there's no connectivity on
site. Is it odd that I'm sort of hoping that there won't be good cell coverage
there, while also looking forward to some dedicated laptop time?

We shall see. I'm told that the camp I'm traveling to contains a trailhead for
a longer backpacking trail. I may be exploring that extensively on foot. Or
I may decide not to, if I can handle the probably extensive feelings of
self-judgement around "wasting a perfectly good opportunity" to enjoy the
outdoors. We shall see which particular set of attachments are stronger, my
attachment to how one *should* camp or my addiction to technology.

Or maybe, just maybe, the whole point is to just have some unstructured time,
and do whatever I feel like doing, without judgement. And that for me is quite
a change from my day-to-day, that I frankly have no idea how to even approach
it.
