A couple of weeks ago I had a dream that I remember. I don't often remember my
dreams but when I do I try to pay attention. The first part of the dream is lost
to me, but there was one of those transitions you get in dreams, like two
different dreams spliced together, and suddenly I was out on a trail that I like
to run on near work, coming back from a run.

During the dream run I had an idea hit me with some clarity, like they often do,
particularly on a return trip. Same voice inside of my head like on an actual
run, clear as day, with the words "I should study Brazilian Percussion."

Actually, it makes a lot of sense that I would be interested in studying Samba.
I've been wanting to step up my chops on the snare, plus learn some new rhythms
for my drumming. I've been feeling some stagnancy on rhythm composition too.

So I was pretty stoked to discover my buddy Aaron is standing in for his teacher
on a local Samba group. Tonight after work I dropped by his spot in San Jose
to go over some fundamentals, so at the rehearsal on Saturday I wouldn't be
completely lost, just a total n00b.

It was really fun to rock out on the snare drum, standing in his living room
working on a couple of stick fundamentals. I caught some video of his hands
working through them, so I can hopefully log a couple of short practice sessions
on a practice pad between now and Saturday.

Ever since I studied percussion in college all of us trap kit drummers held the
marching band drummers in awe. It was always the way to get massive chops. And
I gotta say, it's so much fun to play in a percussion line.

Probably need to make some time to work on
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, as we were hoping to have that new UI
spun up soon.
