From paint day yesterday I found a distinct lack of the right kind of glue was
enough of a problem to justify a quick trip to Game Kastle after work today.
They have a new location in Mountain View, so after work I popped by.

I was stoked to see the bigger space then the older store over in Santa Clara.
They've got a well-defined store area with a reasonable amount of stock,
surrounded by a large open gaming space. First think I noticed is that they are
making Kill Team specific box sets, and picked up one for the Dark Eldar.

I also went for one of the Millennium Falcon models from that Star Wars X-Wing
ship game. I've held off on getting those because I don't play the game and it
felt odd to just buy a part of a game because I thought the model was pretty.

It's funny how fixed my lines of thought are along these things. When it comes
to gaming I can have a pretty strong sense of
[Functional Fixedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_fixedness),
given how long it took me to figure out that nobody was going to fault me for
buying a mini that I had no intention of playing the game for it.

Now I'm home watching the next movie in our
[Dwayne Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_Johnson_filmography) and
boy it's a weird one, [Pain & Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_%26_Gain).

In any event, hoping to finish gluing together some of the Tyranid Cultists
that I started on yesterday. Not sure if I really had the time for an additional
hobby, but there ya go.
