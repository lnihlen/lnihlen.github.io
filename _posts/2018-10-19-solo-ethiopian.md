Many fit calls today and tomorrow, as I'm ramping up the recruiting effort to
allow it to expand to fill all available capacity. After work I was tempted to
just run home, thinking that the dogs had probably had enough of being locked
away all day, but I was craving Ethiopian food for dinner.

I wasn't sure, however, about eating alone. This is new, I think. I've never had
a real problem eating alone before, and in fact (with all due respect to my wife)
rather enjoyed eating alone during my bachelor days. I eat alone at work about
half of the time, particularly on days when I'm too busy to take the time for
a proper lunch to meet someone.

I think it's the combination of it being Friday night, so the beginning of the
weekend and the fact that Ethiopian food is such a communal dining experience.
The food is served family style and is supposed to be shared. I think also
going to Ethiopian is a ritual for Hilary and me, so it particularly felt
out of place for me to be going alone.

It wasn't actually that bad. I certainly was the only person in the restaurant
eating alone. And the food was as delicious as ever. But I sure will be glad
when Hilary is back in town.

I see from the tracking email that the rackmount server has arrived. Looking
forward to picking that up tomorrow. I might get to work on the chat application
later tonight, but given how fried I'm feeling right now, odds are looking low.
