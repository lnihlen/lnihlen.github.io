Remember that whole thing yesterday where I was deciding it might make sense to
take a problem decomposition approach to music creation and work on sound
generation? Yeah maybe that's going to a take a while to figure out. I'm aware
of the discipline of Sound Design, and know that it's a career path and an
industry with a skill set and body of knowledge to accompany. I didn't mean to
imply some arrogance that I was just going to turn around and start cranking out
top-quality sounds from day one.

It's funny because when I write it out it would be unrealistic to expect that,
with my limited experience in sound design, that I would be able to reach any
kind of quality or expressiveness with a few hours of work. My expectations for
myself are not consistent with reality here.

There's one of those longstanding jokes among programmers *of a certain age*,
like myself, I think originally attributed to
[Larry Wall](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Larry_Wall), about the three
programmer's virtues:

  * Impatience
  * Hubris
  * Sloth

For me it's a joke that's stuck with me because it contains a measure of wisdom
about begin effective as a programmer. It's also reflective of a kind of
classical programmer humor, wisdom gained through harsh experience, good advice
with a vein of cynicism. The impetus of many innovations in software can be
seen as coming from impatience or sloth, with a slow or tedious experience in
work leading to the automation or optimization of that workflow. And hubris
gives programmers the false courage to get enough down the road of planning
and implementation of that new software idea that by the time folks realize
just what an incredible amount of hard work the new idea really is there's
enough sunk cost that some of the time folks will just keep going.

So here's my confession - making music at the level of quality that I would like
to make is actually incredibly hard for me. Maybe for some others it's easy,
and for them I'm equal parts of admiring, jealous, and confounded. I'm
confounded because I can't possibly imagine this kind of thing feeling easy. I
have to wonder, for someone amazing like Pauline Oliveros, was it easy for her
to make music? To assume so I think probably discounts a great deal of work that
she did.

Hubris? Is it serving me here? Is it hubris or naivete? What's the difference,
really?

Maybe part of it is the abstract art problem. Like it's easy to appreciate the
work a classically trained musician has put in to mastering their craft. There's
a road to follow, a tradition of that kind of music that requires intense
self-discipline and practice. Anybody who's tried to build a relationship with
a musical instrument on a serious basis understand this immediately. But with
nontraditional music there's maybe this presumption that because there isn't
a tradition of hard work and discipline that those elements must not be there.
It's like somebody looking at a painting by
[Agnes Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Martin) and thinking that
anyone could do that, it must be easy.

Another perspective might be that nontraditional musical forms actually
require more work, or as much work as mastery of any musical form but work of
a different nature. It is a journey into the trackless wilderness. So not only
must one hike that trail, and go as far as one can down it, they must blaze
that trail as well.

And maybe sometimes, for some folks, maybe some time for me, making music will
be effortless. And that would be rad, those times can be special. But just
because it's super hard for unimpressive results for me right now doesn't mean
that I should give up.
