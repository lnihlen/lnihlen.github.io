We had the first Caixa sectional today after work. It was practice-pad only, as
Aaron was (understandably) concerned about alienating his neighbors. What a
trip, to sit in his living room hammering away on the practice pad in my lap,
listening to the metronome on his phone, going in and out of phase with other
folks on their pads, trying to hold it all together.

There are some complex sticking patterns that I'm still trying hit even at
a slower tempo. I had the experience of training to failure as we ratcheted
the tempo up slowly past my ability to follow. Aaron shared a video of a famous
percussionist playing the beat we're practicing at target tempo and, suffice to
say, I've got a long way to go.

Still pretty nervous about tomorrow's {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
performance. We'll be getting up early to head over the hill and set up. The
whole thing will be over by 2 in the afternoon. I'm taking the day off from
work so I have focus on the performance and not feel rushed. Should be great
fun. I was thinking after the show, I should bump the revision number of
the [SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD) Quark to 1.0.0, and maybe
all of the other Quarks too. Nothing like a live performance to consider the
pieces as "released."
