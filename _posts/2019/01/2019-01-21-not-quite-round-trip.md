Headed over the hill early to help Hilary with an issue with her car. Then,
since I was over the hill, I bounced around a few cafes, trying to make some
additional progress on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code before
today's rehearsal.

I was able to get the code edits to be reflected in the UI part of the
[SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD). This is starting to really
feel like a
[CASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering) tool,
and like any other Computer-Aided Software Engineering tool, the "holy grail"
is what they call "round-trip engineering." That is, changes to code are
reflected in the updated UI, and changes in the UI are updated in the code.

So I'm part of the way there. If I had about 45 more minutes today I might have
made it. But I was furiously hacking away while folks were filing in and
starting to set up the gear, and it became time to commit and push what I had,
so we could get some folks oriented to it and using the code.

I might have gone too deep on building the parser, not leaving enough time to
really build out the app wide enough for tonight's usability. Or there just
might not have been enough time between project conception and first prototype
deliverable due to finish a project of this scope.

The next student recital in Wednesday, so I might have some time tomorrow night
to take a crack at finishing the round trip.
