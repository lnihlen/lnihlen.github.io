The rehearsal with {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} this past Sunday
had me feeling really excited about advancing my own solo noise project to the
point that I could start getting some recordings, leading to hopefully a gig
or two.

I have a note in [Keep](http://keep.google.com) with a bunch of potential names
for projects. I've talked about {% include tag_link.html tag="garden_party" %}
once or twice here, and I still feel like that's a great name, but might be more
of an umbrella term for various sonic projects that I'm associated with. Or
maybe a record label one day? I say that with having only the idea that I have
no idea what that would entail.

On the other hand, {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} is a name that
had jumped out to me a while ago as a great name for a noise project, so I'm
settling on that. I want to do some more jamming on the modular setup, start
putting together a live set, and record a demo of that.

There's also the promotional stuff, lots to do here, but my suspicion is that
it might get a little easier to make progress on the brand if there are sounds
and a concept happening first. That's not to say I didn't make enquiries today
about ```egregious.com``` only to find that the owners would take a cash payment
of *literally 100x* what I'm willing to pay for the domain. So moving on to
plan B there.

Other than that excitement it was a fairly typical Thursday. The first signs
of perf are on the wind, with all of the attendant preparations and emotional
labor beginning to spin up. 'tis the circle of life at Google.
