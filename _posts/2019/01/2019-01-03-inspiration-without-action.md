There's still a somewhat slower than average meeting load at work, as much of
the leadership team is still away, so I had some time at work to sit at my desk.
I was able to do a lot of the work that usually has to wait until I get home,
and even poke around a bit on Bandcamp to find some new music to listen to.

Sometimes I go on Bandcamp and it feels like that there's a lot of great music
on there but not a lot of great music for me personally. Like, it's not
Bandcamp, it's me. But today was not that day. I found a lot of great stuff,
including an [older release](https://benfrost.bandcamp.com/album/by-the-throat)
by Ben Frost. I also spent a lot of time on the
[irr app (ext.)](https://irrappext.bandcamp.com/) discog page trying to figure
out if there's a way I could just buy their entire discography without having
to click through all of it.

I think the listening left me motivated to make some sounds but also with a
massive sense of imposter syndrome. So when I got home I just pushed some cables
around, read the manual to my Moog Minitaur, found the mounting screws for a
couple modules and mounted them, etc etc.

I think with intimidating projects that have an engineering focus I have two
things that I'm missing when it comes to music projects. One is *confidence* in
my identity, capabilities, background, and training as an engineer. I know that
I've tackled some pretty hard engineering problems in the past, and while the
solutions I built have typically been at least satisfactory. Workable if not
pretty, but something I could put my name on with pride.

The other advantage is that I've learned over time what are some good ways to
approach solving hard engineering problems that have worked well for me over
time. I've *learned how I learn* in certain domains of software engineering,
what things are going to be the most efficient use of my time and will return
the best results quickly. For example  I've learned to skim the reference
documentation but not stress out about understanding it in any great detail,
rather to dig for worked examples that accomplish something similar to what I'm
looking for and build from there.

Making my own music, I have none of that confidence or experience. But perhaps
I could try to apply some of the same problem solving skills from the
engineering domain to approach music making. For example, it might help to
decompose the idea of "finding a sound" or "designing a concept for a solo act"
into smaller pieces, rather than trying to approach that whole thing at once.

Decomposition is a basic engineering practice that's often quite helpful with
intractable-seeming problems, where you just keep breaking the problem down into
smaller and smaller subproblems until they have obvious solutions. I'll need to
give some thought to what some smaller subgoals could be but this seems like a
promising direction.

I think I might be able to start with some written descriptions of individual
sounds that I would like to make. Just that. If I think of a song as composing
a fairly complex program (with SuperCollider, interestingly, that could be
exactly what it is), then individual sounds can be thought of as just individual
subroutines, simple subcomponents that could be assembled into larger, more
complex things. We put aside concerns around live performance, overall concept,
name of project, website, aesthetics, political implications, album structure,
tone, mood, needed gear, or other things.

So first goal for now will be to build up some colors for my sonic palette. That
is, document a bunch of sounds both in recording format as well as means of
creation. I think I will focus on that for a while, and worry about those other
issues later.

More to come.
