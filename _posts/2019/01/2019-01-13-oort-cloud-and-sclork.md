Hilary had a chance to visit a longtime friend of hers who was visiting family
up in Santa Rosa, so after some {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} waffles
for breakfast she got on the road, leaving the house to me and the animals.

Walks aside, however, I spent a good deal of time in my office hacking on
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code. I had hoped to get the refactor
to [SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat) to take advantage of the
SCLOrkWire code that was mostly finished, modulo bugs.

The chat client and server was more of a rewrite than it was a refactor, and
I modified the API a bit on the client code to clean it up and make it more
consistent. This was a continuation of work started yesterday evening, and I
was encouraged to see that I was able to simplify both client and server even
further, while likely increasing reliability due to the underlying support
from the wire work.

I was able to make good progress, even getting life signs out of the refactored
code, with only a few obvious bugs around reconnection left. Then it was time
to start getting ready for the first
{% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} rehearsal of the new year. It
was great to see the band. I think we spent about half the time just hanging
out and chatting, and the other half actually practicing. It sounded like
Grawer has written some new material, and we also need to get cracking on a
couple of different recording projects for singles, as we have agreed to
collaborate on a few different splits with partner bands.

There's talk of us playing Day of Noise over at KZSU this year, which we got to
do 2 years ago, and in general I'm feeling a renewed sense of enthusiasm for and
interest in the band. Super glad about that.

The band wrapped up, and after a lengthy chat session catching up I got a little
bit more time to find and fix the last few bugs in the SCLOrkChat refactor.

Then Hilary made it back from Santa Rosa (which is a super-long drive), we had
a late dinner together, hung out for a bit, then it was time for bed.
