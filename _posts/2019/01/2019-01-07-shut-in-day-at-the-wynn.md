I tried to attend as many of my usual Monday meeting load over video conference
from the hotel room today, so that kept me relatively close to the desk in my
room. Outside of a brief walk to CVS then I didn't leave the room.

I did a quick walk through the gym inside the hotel but they didn't have any
free weights, outside of the typical rack of dumbbells in front of a giant
mirror, and a very sad-looking barbell trapped inside of a Smith rack. So won't
be going back there.

This left me a lot of time, both to get through my work backlog and to make
significant headway on a design document for SCLOrkWire, the reliable UDP-based
OSC network communication class.

Speaking of {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, I'm still eager to hear
how the first couple of days of work with the classes I've already written
are going, and I'm sure I will hear, once the dust settles from the first week
of school at Santa Clara University. I remember from my student and teacher days
both how hectic those first few weeks can be.

So, in the meantime, I'll refactor a bunch of code to increase reliability using
the SCLOrkWire class, once finished. I can then add in the network clock stuff
too, that also relies on the SCLOrkWire messaging framework for the control
channels. So lots to do on this project, as always. But I'm still being careful
to work in branches, keeping mainline clear for any patches that need to sneak
in.

Tomorrow is a day for meetings, as well as a chance to walk the CES floor.
Should be lots of shiny, huge TVs. Last year there was a small electric
motorcycle section, hoping I can stumble upon that again, and hoping it will be
bigger.
