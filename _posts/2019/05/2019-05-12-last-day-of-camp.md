Up again early for another dawn chorus. This being my second one I felt like an old hand (hah!). We had scouted
recording locations the previous evening, and so I was able to find my way back to my preferred spot in the dark and
set up my mic with (relative) ease. After that I joined our two gracious hosts James and Molly for a sit in a grassy
field while we watched the sun rise on Montpellier. One of my fancier mornings, I must admit.

CAMP has been an incredible experience. I think I'll need some time just to unpack everything and digest it. First
impressions is that it is one of those moments in a person's life that brings in to focus a lot of things that have
been kind of developing, quietly, on their own in different, disconnected domains in a life. Another thing that stands
out is what a talent and role model Chris Watson is. He's a giant of an artist, and it's been an incredible privilege
to listen to him and with him on this journey through France.

It's noteworthy that this is easily the longest I've gone without checking my work email in the close to 9 years (!)
that I've been employed at Google. Not even peeking since I left Santa Cruz. That probably will end tomorrow but the
break has been really powerful. I feel much more comfortable in my own skin than I have in a while.

More work on the parse tree reflection project in {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} today as well. When
I'm not tramping about the French countryside or listening to Chris talk us through his thinking about one of his
albums I'm hacking away on this project. It's been a quite fascinating trip into some of the bowels of the SuperCollider
interpreter. When the Internet became available for a moment earlier I was able to upload
[a PR](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4402) to github for review, asking for preliminary feedback
on overall approach only. I was glad to get some approval a bit later, and relieved, because while it's been quite fun
I have several other projects on hold for this (the Asset manager for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} as well
as of course {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}, for example) so if I'm working on something that's not
useful that's really too bad and I'd rather stop. Sounds like this is not the case, however, so yay!

Tomorrow we're going to have "a bit of a lie-in," as our British host James says, but need to be ready to leave to
arrive in Toulouse with enough time for people to catch their connections back to the world. It'll be sad to part ways
with such excellent folk but on the other hand I'm not sure I can fit much more in this brain at the moment. And it'd
certainly be great to be both back in a bed that I fit in (my back is killing me!) as well as have consistent access
to the Internet.

All in all, I may have felt like a bit of a fool when I started this whole adventure, but I'd have to say it's been
great fun. And tomorrow Hilary shows up in Toulouse and we'll be together for a week! All the better.
