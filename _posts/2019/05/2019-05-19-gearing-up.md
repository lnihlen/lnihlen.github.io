Today is the last day of my vacation, as well as Hilary's last full day here in London. I started mentally preparing for
my return to work yesterday with the clearing of the email inbox, and today continued that process as I checked for
followups to some of my emails (unlikely given that it's the weekend) and read more thoroughly some of the emails that
had survived my first triage.

Hilary and I took a walk over to Westminster Abbey but with Sunday services going on the place was not available for
tourism, which on a Sunday morning seemed appropriate. The architecture here in London is incredible and the Abbey is
exemplary in that regard.

The plan was to see the presentation of a new commission by the teacher of the CAMP field recording class, Chris Watson,
that was sponsored by the Serpentine Gallery. We were to meet Clara, a fellow student of the CAMP class and modular
synth musician, for dinner before. Since Harrod's was over by the Serpentine Gallery we had high tea again for lunch
there, then rolled over to the Natural History museum to look at some awesome old bones. There was an awesome art
display up there about the moon. It was a large room there with soft blue lighting and a giant model of the moon hung in
the center. Super cool.

It was then that I noticed the email from Clara saying she would meet us in front of a rail station well across town.
And then I realized that the show, while sponsored by the Serpentine Gallery, was in a different venue close to where
Clara was proposing we meet. So, we made a quick run through the gift shop and then headed across town to meet Clara.

The space, called EarTH, was a really cool converted theater with a bar/kitchen downstairs. Chris Watson was there with
his wife Maggie, and Hilary got to meet them. But unfortunately we had missed his talk earlier in the day, and his
performance was going to be much later in the evening. With Hilary getting sick plus flying overseas tomorrow, and me
wanting an early start on the return to work week, it was time to pack it in.

It was great to catch up with Clara but it was a shame to miss Chris's set. But we're switching gears, back over to a
work routine, and have to respect the needs of that moment. It will be interesting to work a week in the London office,
if a bit challenging trying to be an effective manager with an 8 hour time difference between here and Mountain View.
I'm foreseeing a few later-evening meetings in my immediate future. But it feels good to return to something that is a
little routine, a little familiar, and getting more so as I get closer to the day of my own flight home.
