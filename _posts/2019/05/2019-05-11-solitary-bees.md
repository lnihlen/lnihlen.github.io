Today opened rainy and so we took a break from hiking around the incredible French countryside and instead had a series
of listening sessions indoors. There was a chance for folks to share their recordings although I observe that I wasn't
the only one who find the idea of having Chris Watson listen to one of your field recordings a little bit intimidating.
The advanced practitioners did share some of their work, and that was great to hear because much of it was quite good,
and it was also instructive to observe Chris listening critically to their work and pointing out interesting details.
Chris has an encyclopedic knowledge of both nature (particularly birds) as well as audio recording techniques, so he
makes for a fascinating instructor.

In the evening we headed to a location in the mountains allowing ready access to some real wilderness. My reflection
on this hike was that I'm really ready to start some field recording in earnest, and it will require some additional
gear and a lot of time of solitary (or possibly with Hilary) exploration and practice. Still thinking of the name of
this project but I have an idea for a website for it, as well as the idea for a new music label for me to self-release
on, called {% include tag_link.html tag="solitary_bees" %}.

I've long struggled with taking myself seriously as an artist. In fact, even writing that sentence I had the inclination
to soften "artist" to "creative person" or some such. This is an attempt to change that. Solitary Bees is me saying that
I have a record label and it is going to put out records. More when I have consistent access to the Internet and am not
on a 4:15a start for another dawn chorus tomorrow.

When I wasn't inventing whole new piles of work for myself today I did grab some more time to hack on my parser for
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}. I had some key, value sort of Arrays being created in C++ from the
parse tree and being passed back to the SuperCollider language side. Things were going surprisingly smoothly, but I
think I've hit my first snag - the garbage collector is stripping a great deal of what I am returning away. I think
I see a pattern in some other interpreter code that I can use, though, so will be doing a bit of refactoring on that,
again, when I don't have a 4:15a start.

Speaking of..
