[This post](https://aiweirdness.com/post/185248506967/neural-net-names-effects-pedals) on aiweirdness had me in stiches. It really is a critical weakness in
my funny bone. Computer-generated absurdity is best absurdity. I hadn't seen that site before, and spent a lot of time in the afternoon distracted by various
articles here and then trying not to laugh out loud during some of the Friday meetings I was attending at work. It got me thinking about machine learning again,
maybe spending some time building up the metal logo database for a deep learning metal logo generator, an idea I've been percolating for a long time.

Home at a reasonable hour thanks to the motorcycle being able to carve through some pretty nuts traffic both going in to Shoreline Amphitheathre (some kind of
Grateful Dead thing?), then queueing up for the drive over the 17 to points south, possibly the beach. 

The goal this evening was to assemble the brooder for the {% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %},
to have it ready for rock n' roll as soon as I get home tomorrow morning with the chicks. I used the Dremel to cut a large hole in the lid, put some plastic
chicken wire over the hole, cleaned out the interior, lined it with newspaper (I hear the pine shreds are too big to be comfortable for the chicks the first week),
set up the heater and water supply.

I did this in the living room, hopefully not annoying Hilary too much while we watched the finale for RuPaul's Drag Race. I was glad to see Yvie Oddly win,
she's been a favorite all season. Then jamming some more with Hollow Knight and it was once again time for bed.
