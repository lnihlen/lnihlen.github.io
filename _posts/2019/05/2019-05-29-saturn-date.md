Not a particularly eventful day outside of a full work meeting docket. After the commute home Hilary and I decided to
pop over to the hardware store for some tie-downs, because I'm delivering a spare bed to a new home, and will be
clearing the guest bedroom in the house to make more room in my office to convert it into a studio. In any event, the
bed is going to be in the back of my pickup truck so I needed some tie downs, and Hilary wanted to get a few of those
metal frames that you put around a potted tomato plant, which she called "tomato supporters," a name that I loved and is
now what they are called in our household.

Tomato supporters and tie-downs secured, we headed over to Saturn for some dinner. I'm enjoying the greatly expanded
menu options now that dairy is back in my diet, so it was fun to order some of the cheesier things on the menu. Hilary
and I split the cheese fries with garlic, which was delicious.

But that was pretty much my night. We got back to the house a bit after 9pm, and it was time to wind it down for bed.
