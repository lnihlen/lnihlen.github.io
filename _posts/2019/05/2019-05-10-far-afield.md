Today was an epic day. I woke up at 3:30am again, I think the jet lag is still wearing on me. But that was some good
time to work on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} asset sharing system, as well as take a stab then at some
of the early parsing work I want to bring in to {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}.

I've been wanting to have richer access to the parser/lexer part of SuperCollider inside the language for a variety of
reasons now, and this talk of an automatic code formatting tool for sclang is the final impetus for me to take a crack
at it. With only a little bit of work I've been able to add a primitive alongside the one for compiling a string which
will just parse it and then post the parse tree to the postln. That was with less than an hour to work on it today,
so I'm now thinking about what data structure I could have the system return, and what that might then look like for
a code formatter to go from.

One of the challenges here is that the parse tree is very obviously reordering some things and prepping for the code to
be interpreted. It's purpose-built for that in the language, so it's not giving me the most intuitive or obvious parse
back. But maybe if I spend some more time with it and examine the output from various test cases it will start to make
more sense.

Once it was time to start the day with the rest of the folks I went down and after a breakfast of bread and cheese
(yes, I'm doing some dairy out here, you basically have to if you want to eat anything other than bread), we spent
almost the entire day outdoors. Chris took us to two separate locations in the morning, then back to the CAMP facilities
for a quick and late bite of lunch, then out again until almost dark at a third location.

I had an incredible Zen moment in the evening, standing at the crest of a part of a mountain, looking down on a valley.
The trees rustled gently in the wind and I could hear the faint melody of cowbells coming from a small herd down below.
It was one of those perfect moments in life, so rare, and so special when they do happen.

Then back for a late dinner. Chris is showing a pre-release film he did much of the sound design on but I'm completely
bushed so off to bed. It was a truly remarkable day, however. I feel more comfortable in my own skin right now than
I have in a very long time indeed.
