You never know what to expect when you sign up for a course like this, particularly in the middle of the forest in a
foreign country. I have to say, so far, this course has not disappointed. We started the morning in this incredible
listening space upstairs with what Hilary would call in Yoga training a "sharing circle," meaning everybody spoke about
their motivation for being in the course, background, and learning objectives. There are 15 of us, ranging in experience
from total novice like myself to professional audio people looking to expand their horizons. There are people from
radio and film as well as music, and one other engineer, although he's retired, but it gives me hope to not be the only
computer nerd here.

There really isn't anyone in the group that doesn't seem cool. Next was a walking tour of Aulus-les-Baines, since this
was our first time really seeing it in daylight that was helpful to orient. We didn't carry any audio gear with us,
but the teacher helped a lot by pointing out different locations he had previously scouted, and talking a bit about his
thought process in choosing that location.

What impresses me about [Chris Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Watson_%28musician%29), the teacher, is that
he is constantly listening critically to his sonic environment. I also learned to be sensitive to dynamic range by
listening to sound intensities in comparison to one another.

After lunch we took a short drive to the peak of one of the (many) nearby mountains. The fog started to roll in, and
became quite thick, so it made serious adventuring hard but I did manage to grab a few recordings with a handheld Zoom
recorder. Chris wanted to show us more in the area but the rain started to come down hard so we headed back to the
village.

Then it was time for dinner and me for an early bed. We're up at 4am tomorrow for the dawn chorus, as promised.
