Well the hope had been to get some serious work done on the laptop on the overnight flight but that was assuming
I wasn't going to be packed into one of the two middle seats in Economy class, meaning for a larger guy like me
that basically if I'm not activating my deltoids to squeeze my elbows in to my sides I'm pretty much actively
invading the space of the folks on either side of me.

This is kind of a drag, particularly given the screen roughly a foot from my face is telling me that I've got
another 7 hours and 28 minutes to go on the flight. So. Lots of time to work on documentation maybe? I may end
up springing for the inflight WiFi so that I can at least get a recent pull from the
[SCLOrkTools](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkTools) repository. We're trying that now. But I am keenly aware
that pulling my elbows back to my side far enough to type, even on this narrow/short iPad Pro keyboard, has my
gut forcing them out so that they invade the space of my neighbors. I don't like being that guy, I really don't.

Aside from that, I at least had the presence of mind to download a few books onto this iPad, and have been
enjoying switching between Scott Meyer's *Effective Modern C++* and *C++ High Performance* by Sehr and Andrist.
Oh and the inflight WiFi is free, so that's some small compense.

Although it may be a few more hours before I can get out of my seat without waking up my neighbor I think we've
reached some sort of peace, with her rotated a bit towards her right as she leans into her seat, giving my right
elbow some space, and my left-hand neighbor hugging herself with her arms crossed and leaning back, leaving a
pocket for my left elbow to also fit in. This really is ridiculous how crammed in we are back here. This part
of the trip really is about the destination, not the journey there.

I'm cranking down the brightness of this display to minimum, hopefully the battery will hold until either we
arrive or I can find an unobtrusive time to break this equilibrium on both sides and grab a charger from my
backpack.

I have managed to make some progress on some documentation for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %},
and given that I have in-flight WiFi I'm thinking I might start roughing in some of the code for the
AssetManager on the C++ side, giving me a chance to work on some of the exciting new filesystem abraction
stuff in C++-17. That's a piece that's largely orthogonal to the work I had started on my laptop but
hadn't bothered to commit. Grumble grumble again about my assumption about being able to work on my laptop
on the flight.

It's probably even healthy for me to have to improvise a bit here with my gear, break some of my normal
access patterns, examine some of my attachments to outcomes and tools alike. And who am I to complain,
really? I'm on a plane to *freakin' France* after all. As cramped and uncomfortable as this is, I'm not
losing sight of what an incredible treat this is, and how lucky I am to be here. Elbow politik and all.
