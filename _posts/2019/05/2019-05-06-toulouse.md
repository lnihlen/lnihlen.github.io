Well that flight from LAX to LHR never really did get any better. Then there was a short layover in Heathrow where
I caught a bus to a different terminal, then an hour and twenty minute flight to Toulouse. I haven't slept since I got
up Sunday morning in Santa Cruz, so my brain is feeling something like the consistency of porridge right now. Given that
I'll be on this timezone (or near it) for most of May, I figured it was time to pull in the blog post cadence to match.

Everything is super beautiful. It's my first time in mainland Europe. I can't stop smiling at how cool this is. But
it's also totally overwhelming. Everything is in French, which well yeah, of course, but I'm so out of it that is
actually a bit of a barrier. It's still light out here but I'm going to knock off, get some rack time. Hopefully when
I wake up I'll be a bit more able to function. Tomorrow I have some time to kill, hopefully a chance to wander a bit
and get comfortable, before meeting a minibus that will take me out to the countryside to begin the field recording
course officially on Wednesday.

I've been waiting a bit for the adventure to start, and now that it's finally here it feels great. But for now, to bed.
