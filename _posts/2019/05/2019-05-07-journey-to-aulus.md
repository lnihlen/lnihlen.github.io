Slept in as late as possible in the hotel in Toulouse, which despite very comfortable accomodations and blackout curtains was only
until around 4am. Then up, put in a few hours work on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} confab project until the breakfast
opened at 6:30. Breakfast was the buffet in the hotel and was quite good. 

Then back up to the room for more working until about 10:30 when I could start to feel the city waking up around me. I went down and
took a couple of miles walk around the city, following a loop the hotel had suggested for runners but at more of a stroll pace. There's
a lot of beautiful architecture here, and a wide, lazy green river.

TODO: a few images of Toulouse here.

My French is terrible and I'm feeling very self-concious about it, so after awkwardly getting myself some lunch I retired to the hotel
room for a lot more hacking on the SCLOrk code. I've got some one-way communication going betweeen SuperCollider and the confab binary,
which is letting me work out a lot of the mechanics of that for future use in {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}. My C++
could use a refresher for that and I'm enjoying the time spent in that language.

I waited around the hotel as long as I could stand, waiting until that 6pm pickup time when I'm expected at the Toulouse train station
for a shuttle/bus/van ride to the next leg of my journey, in Aulus-les-Baines, which is where I think I'm headed. Anyway, the literature
from the course seems to always just call it Aulus, and it seems to be the only location around Toulouse answering to that description,
so my supposition is that is where I am headed.

Not sure if I'll have reliable Internet connectivity there or what, so this may be a checkpoint post until I figure that out. Assuming I
do, I'm planning on revisiting this entry a bit later with some edits to add photos and update the rest of the day's journey.

Until then, hopefully soon.
