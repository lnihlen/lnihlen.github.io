Slept in as late as possible in the hotel in Toulouse, which despite very comfortable accomodations and blackout
curtains was only until around 4am. Then up, put in a few hours work on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
confab project until the breakfast opened at 6:30. Breakfast was the buffet in the hotel and was quite good.

Then back up to the room for more working until about 10:30 when I could start to feel the city waking up around me. I
went down and took a couple of miles walk around the city, following a loop the hotel had suggested for runners but at
more of a stroll pace. There's a lot of beautiful architecture here, and a wide, lazy green river.

My French is terrible and I'm feeling very self-concious about it, so after awkwardly getting myself some lunch I
retired to the hotel room for a lot more hacking on the SCLOrk code. I've got some one-way communication going betweeen
SuperCollider and the confab binary, which is letting me work out a lot of the mechanics of that for future use in
{% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}. My C++ could use a refresher for that and I'm enjoying the time spent
in that language.

I waited around the hotel as long as I could stand, waiting until that 6pm pickup time when I'm expected at the Toulouse
train station for a shuttle/bus/van ride to the next leg of my journey, in Aulus-les-Baines, which is where I think I'm
headed. Anyway, the literature from the course seems to always just call it Aulus, and it seems to be the only location
around Toulouse answering to that description, so my supposition is that is where I am headed.

After a wait just long enough that I began to entertain the dark fantasy that this was all an elaborate Internet scam
the CAMP team showed up, right on time, with the teacher Chris Watson in tow, and we all climbed into two vans for the
roughly two hour drive to Aulus-les-Baines. The mountains ahead look straight out of a postcard. We arrived just before
dark and after an unremarkable meal were shown our individual rooms in the converted hotel.

We have instructions to meet tomorrow at 10am, with a warning that many morning start times will not be nearly so
humane, but because of travel we are given more time to rest, which is fine by me. I'm laughingly thinking that just
about when my jetlag comes back to normal and I'm ready to sleep to 8 or 9 will be when they start pushing us to be
up at 4.

The WiFi comes and goes but for the moment seems fine. I'll continue to poke my nose out when I can.
