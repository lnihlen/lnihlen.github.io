Today was the last day at work and I'm completely zapped. I've been pulled in to so many different situations recently where, I realize now, I've been
relied on by others on my team, or sometimes not even on my team but *near* my team, for some kind of emotional support. Managers are not therapists,
we are not trained as such and in fact even if I was that's not my role. On the other hand, being emotionally unavailable is also not a great option
for a manager. There's a balance to strike here, but my intuition is that I've gone *way* over to the side of too much.

How did we end up here? Might be worth thinking about a bit. I've got a new manager coming on my team, meaning that when I get back I'll only be
managing managers on my team. So I'm hoping that I can use this break to reset the pattern to something a bit more healthy for us both. I'm here to
be an engineering leader, a coach and a mentor. I'm not here to be a dumping ground for every bummer feeling you might be bringing to work or having
in your life. How I ended up there may have more to do with my own poor boundaries and insecurities than it does with any bad action on the part of
these other people.

I will need to have the confidence in myself to accept that I can be effective at my job and stay within those boundaries. But when the chips go down
I worry I'll fall back on these old habits. Perhaps some time away to reflect can help.
