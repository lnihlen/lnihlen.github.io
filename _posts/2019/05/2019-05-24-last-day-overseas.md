Today I am confident both that I still love to travel and that I'm absolutely sick of it. This is said only partly for comedic effect.
On the balance, things really aren't all that bad here. London is quite lovely. I don't know how I can be in a city this huge and yet
feel so comfortable. The Google office here is also quite nice, with many of my coworkers thinking that the food is superior to that
of our humble Mountain View headquarters. It's been great to interact with the team, our work has been productive. All in all a useful
business trip to an incredible location.

I miss my wife and I miss my dogs. I can tell I'm getting antsy to get home because I'm starting to make a list of tasks and projects
I'm excited to get started on when I'm there. Yay for homework! As long as it's *home*. This is a three day weekend for me, so while I
am traveling all tomorrow, and it will be an extradordinarily long day due to the flight back across eight time zones, I'm grateful that
I'll be getting two whole days after to recover.

I've got a few books downloaded on to the iPad, and hopefully this time back the seat will be large enough that I could potentially work
on my laptop some without invading the personal space of my neighbors. One can hope, anyway.

Another long day at the office today followed by the requisite team dinner, this time at [ROVI](https://ottolenghi.co.uk/rovi), which
was pretty incredible. Plant-focused, locally sourced, and extremely tasty. I am to understand we were quite lucky to get a table for 12,
but if you find yourself in London I'd recommend a trip.

I have depleted my available vacation days at work to almost nothing, and it's less than halfway through the year. But I was just
contemplating how much shorter these blog entries get once I return to work. Balance, in all things, I suppose. I'm looking at a long
slog at work I think, outside of maybe some health-related travel in July. I'm not mad at it, because I will be in the spot in the world
that I've carved out for myself. I will be home. Tomorrow.
