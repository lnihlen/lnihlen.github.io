Up early to record the dawn chorus. I'm not a big bird person, like I appreciate birds and think birds are beautiful but
I couldn't name 5 different kinds of wild birds without having to think for a minute. I certainly can't identify a kind
of bird by only a silhouette or the sound of its call. All of that said, recording the dawn chorus, that is the time
shortly before dawn up into full light where a mass of birds awaken and begin to sing, is sort of a right of passage
for field recordists, and I was glad to participate, particularly in an environment as exquisite as this.

It is a privilege to go out into the woods with someone with the kind of deep knowledge and experience that our
instructor Chris Watson has and listen to him explain site selection, recording technique, and general approach to
capturing wildlife sounds. And, sitting with my fellow classmates in a field behind the church graveyard in the French
backcountry, silently waiting to hear the birds come to life in the predawn air, is the kind of deep listening exercise
that feels like a great blessing. I'm grateful for it.

The rest of the day was similarly spectacular, but I'm totally drained. I've skipped dinner and am winding down to try
and catch a bit of rest this evening. I'm sure tomorrow is going to be similarly intense, and I want to make the most
of it.
