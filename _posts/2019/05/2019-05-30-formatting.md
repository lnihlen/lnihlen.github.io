Today I sent an [email](https://www.listarc.bham.ac.uk/lists/sc-dev/msg59111.html) to the {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} developer mailing list
announcing the rollout of the large code formatting PR that Brian, one of the most prominent active SuperCollider developers, had been working on landing for months.
It's the completion of an odd, hopefully singular, time in the SuperCollider development history. I certainly do mean what I say in the email that it is the
committee's hope that the development committee can figure out a less divisive and destructive way of resolving these kinds of internal debates. Because I think there
could be a lot more big decisions for the software project, and I hope to see the community survive them.

I am fond of saying that "decisions are the limiting reagent of software development," meaning that often it isn't a lack of folks willing to build stuff or
time/energy for them to build it in, but more that a single unmade decision can spread like a virus through a chain of dependent decisions, until where there was a
shared vision and a software project there is now just a cloud of uncertainty. And, since software is a creative process, uncertainty is a particularly toxic state
for a software team because it smothers creativity. In this case, it certainly has been true, as the entire repository has been in a code freeze for weeks pending
the resolution of the formatting discussion. Now that the formatting PR is in I will need to go back and rebase all of my outstanding PRs, in preparation for them to
be reviewed and (hopefully!) merged.

But I digress. This morning I dropped off the spare mattress that we had been essentially storing in the extra bedroom, making more room for music and computer gear,
which seems to be slowly taking over the house. Really the best possible invasion scenario, if you think about it. So it was up early to load the bed into the truck
and then over the hill to drop it with a grateful recipient from the radio station.

It's also getting to be time to put the finishing touches on the brooder for the incoming {% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, which if I'm not going to be able
to get on Saturday is going to be quite a disappointment. I think I should have everything in order by tomorrow after work, giving me the opportunity to get the brooder
completely set up, even up to the correct temperature, before picking up the chicks Saturday morning. Can hardly wait!
