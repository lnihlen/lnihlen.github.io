Up at a reasonable hour for one last visit to the amazing hotel breakfast buffet and then we caught a cab to the Tolouse
airport. Travel to London was largely uneventful, which is what one wants from travel, and then after an additional long
cab ride we were able to check in to our hotel in London, St. Martin's Lane Hotel. It's very modern and stylish, and
in a busy part of the city, both facts are actually quite a shock coming from first the French countryside, even with
Toulouse providing a nice onramp.

All that aside, London is as awesome as ever. Hilary and I discovered a fantastic Indian restaurant just around the
corner from our hotel where we had a late lunch. Then I got some laptop time in while she took an afternoon nap. I
continued work on the {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} parser, after having written some more rough
design notes while on the plane. I'm settling on a rough design following an iterative approach, where I am slowly
developing heuristics to handle the various curve balls the parser is throwing my way, and then updating the HTML
visualizing tool to help build my understanding of the parser and also my confidence that I'm still headed in the right
direction.

It's been some reverse engineering effort, but I'm starting to feel a bit of optimism that only a few simplification and
normalization steps will return the parse tree to a quite usable form for the purposes of things like automatic
reformatting or better-informed code completion.

Then we were up again for a walk around the city, a little dinner at a local pub, then time for bed. Tomorrow we have a
full day lined up, with high tea service followed by a show at the West End. It's great to be back in London!
