Up early to say good bye to Hilary as she starts her journey back home to the States. Grabbed a cab into the Google
London office for some breakfast. Then it was in for a full day, not getting back to the hotel until 9 pm. One story I
can share is that I took a London Underground ride for over an hour, with congestion so bad at some points that I was
reminded of my Tokyo rush our subway ride. Kind of an intense, sweaty experience but I could see how a commute using the
Underground would be a great way to beat the traffic (and expense) of driving in London.

Tomorrow my calendar is a bit more open so I'm hopeful I'll be able to touch base in the evening with some of the folks
back in California, as well as make some plans for my return to the States next week. But I am aware of the shift in
balance of my available free time from a great deal to near zero. I'd like to reach some equilibrium but understand that
the first few days back that may not be realistic.

All that said I'm glad to be back at work. There are some genuinely interesting challenges in the day job, and I
like the people I work with. So it's all good, and in fact much closer to the norm, but it's definitely a change in pace
from recent weeks.
