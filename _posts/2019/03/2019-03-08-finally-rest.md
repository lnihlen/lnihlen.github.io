Up early again today to head in to work for the first of a series of a
few long meetings around perf. And while there's still a large amount
of work to get done, the remainder is spread out over the next couple
of weeks now and is more about sort of fortifying your position, as
opposed to seizing new ground.

I ate something funny last night and this morning woke up feeling a
touch poisoned, like just upset stomach, achy muscles, light headache.
Nothing spectular enough to warrant a sick day but certainly no shining
moments for me today. I left work as soon as my meeting load was over,
winding back through the comparatively mellow Friday evening commute
home.

We ordered in, watched the new RuPaul's Drag Race Season 11 episode.
I pushed a few CMake files around, working on bringing in the ```hidapi```
library and seeing if I could light anything up on the shiny new WiiMote
I was rockin. Perhaps tomorrow I can dig in a bit more to that in earnest.

Been thinking a lot recently about a longtime love video game for me,
[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/). Sometimes Google
will reccomend Reddit articles from that channel. And I was driving home
tdoay, looking at all stone and trees in the mountains, and started
feeling particularly dwarfy.

So that may actually take up a significant portion of my Saturday. I
have some homework on Sunday, time to update some notes on people as
well as make further progress on the next round of reviews. But I
literally got that feeling walking around today of being "dead on
my feet." It's time for a rest, and I finally feel like tomorrow I
could possibly get one.
