Another long day at work and little time in the evening for much aside from the
homework load. And that's not even done yet, I'm going to have to crash through
some meetings tomorrow to make room for finishing the required paperwork load
in time.

I think the scary thing about times like these is that it will last forever. I'm
not sure I could really handle that. The total exhaustion of this past weekend
could not be the norm for me. The expansion of my workday into every available
corner of my personal time is also not sustainable.

There are lessons in days like today, lessons around taking the job one
challenge at a time, one conversation at a time, chipping away at the mountain
of work until the job is done.

I'm afraid I'll work my whole life and then turn around and wonder what it was
all for. On the other hand I get a lot of meaning out of what I do. I await
the restoration of balance in my life. Until then, I must abide.
