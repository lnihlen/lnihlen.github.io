In what I expect is very nearly the peak of {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} concert
season we performed at Dolby Labs in San Francisco this evening, as part of a fundraising
event for Santa Clara University.

I took the day off for the activity, and after doing [a fill-in](https://www.kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58822)
at {% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}, Hil and I met and drove up together to San Francisco
to help prepare for the show.

And that was pretty much the day - loading in the gear, setting it up, followed by a sound check.
Then we got an impressive tour of some of the facilities in the Lab, specifically a sound room they
use for a variety of purposes, including mixing and mastering of Dolby Atmos surround sound
content. They have a beautiful, full-featured recording facility there, obviously, and
the demos we saw showing of Dolby Vision and Atmos tech were truly impressive.

The performance I would say was easily our best yet, playing to a fairly full house on the stage of
Dolby's high quality theater facility. The think the orchestra was really excited by the surroundings,
inspired by the opportunity, and motivated to represent themselves and their conductor to the
alumni in the best light possible.

I think it was a success, with a lot of positive feedback from audience members as well as staff within
the Alumni association. And while I'm not affiliated with Santa Clara University, besides volunteering
my time to build infrastructure and perform with the Laptop Orchestra, I certainly hope folks were
generous in supporting the school.

It was a grand adventure of a day, but had me leaving the house at 4am for the radio show, and not
returning until just before 11pm. So I will once again be brief, in the interest of getting some
rest.
