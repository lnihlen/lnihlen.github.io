So that time I recently got feedback there were two points that the person
was asking for. The first was that I ease up on my use of swearing at work.

While I am happy to accommodate the individual who protested about the swearing
by limiting my swearing around them, I think after some additional reflection
I'm still going to swear around other folks, in more informal settings at work,
because those folks swear around me, and I think I and others rely on swearing
as both a signifier that what we are saying is authentic, as well as a way to
blow off a little bit of steam.

The other request was that I not disagree with this individual in public. While
I think I can accommodate their request when it comes to disagreement in front
of folks outside of our shared team structure, where it is important to present
a unified front, when it's just our team around I'm going to have to reserve
my right for respectful dissent.

Decisions are the limiting reagent of software development. A large part of my
job is trying to identifying the decisions that need to be made, and then
working with folks to make the best decision we can. Being a lead means making
decisions in the absence of complete information, making a judgement call. Then
comes the part where you communicate the decision broadly and decisively.
Nothing can snarl a team more than a bunch of uncertainty about the state of
an important decision.

So you gotta gather the data, collect input from everyone that wants to provide
it, then call the shot, and consider the matter settled. Strong opinions.

But then, sometimes, like in the Big Lebowsky, "new shit has come to light."
It's important in those situations to re-assess, and change direction if
necessary. And then communicate the new direction broadly and decisively,
once again. Strong opinions, weakly held.

It was a phrase a PM partner of mine, who is much better educated than I,
said to me yesterday after a meeting where I entered 100% committed to the
first direction, and then after some productive dissent in the meeting (that
apparently made some folks uncomfortable) I exited the meeting 100% committed
to the other direction. Because *new shit had come to light, man.*
