I can't think of any weekend that I'd really like to lose an hour of sleep over Saturday night on, but
this weekend in particular seemed particularly ill-suited. Our dog Molly woke us up at what probably
felt like a normal time but that meant we were getting our day started like we had slept in.

I downloaded Hollow Knight on the Switch, and that pretty much consumed the rest of the day. I had
a bit of work homework to take care of, and got to it much later than I had planned, but at least
it's done.

But other than that, the rest of the day was either hanging out with Hilary or getting lost in that
excellent game.

Tomorrow we have a {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal, in preparation for the
Dolby Labs performance on Thursday. It's another totally nuts week at work, but it'll be great
to take Thursday to go up to the city, see the space, and jam out in the evening.

Lots to look forward to this week, which is otherwise wall-to-wall with meetings. I had to ask a
colleague to convert our meeting to a lunch one, otherwise I'm not certain how I'll have time to
eat on a few of these days. Fun!
