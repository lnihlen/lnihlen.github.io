Got up early to head over the hill for the third-to-last day before my
staycation next week. Then home for Thai leftovers with Hilary. She got a call
from a friend and went downstairs for a bit, and that felt like the perfect
time to set up the living room desk again.

Hil is going out of town for a bit and while I'm going to miss her I'm also
hoping to have some real time for heads-down work on
{% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %} as well as hopefully making some
progress on diverse other projects, possibly finishing up some of the projects
I've been doing on {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, perhaps some
renovation and styling on the blog, and maybe some work on
{% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %}. So lots of time sitting at a desk
deeply involved in writing code.

The big hitch in this plan is that I will have the dogs home, by choice as I
don't want to be so lonely, and I don't want to kennel them for the whole time
I'm on my own. But they, particularly our still-mostly-a-puppy Molly, require
constant supervision. Sometimes it feels like Molly will do something
destructive or bad if left unsupervised for any length of time in excess of
around 90 seconds.

So going in to my office and shutting the door seems counterproductive to
keeping the rest of the house in order. So I think it's time for the noble
return of the living room desk.

And that's the big excitement for the day. Ah the intrepid life of your friendly
neighborhood introverted computer nerd.
