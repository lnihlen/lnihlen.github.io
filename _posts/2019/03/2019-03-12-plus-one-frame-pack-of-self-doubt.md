Another terse blog entry thanks to another long day at the office and just not
a ton left in the tank for either noteworthy thoughts to think or commentary
about them. I'm aware of my feeling of vulnerability, and the feeling that
my promo application is incomplete. It's incomplete because it is unanswered,
and will be so for at least a month out.

The exhaustion, I realize, comes from the mantle of self doubt that I'm
wearing at all times. It adds an energetic cost to my every decision, and my
job is to try and make good decisions, you can see how that tax might stack up
fast. I was telling a sympathetic and supportive co-worker today, that's it
feels like how one feels when hiking with a heavy frame backpack. That kind
of bone-deep tired after a long day of hiking around with 40 lbs on your back.

And that incredible feeling of lightness when you finally take it off. Looking
forward to that part.
