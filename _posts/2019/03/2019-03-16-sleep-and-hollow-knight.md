More recovery that quickly blended into procrastination. Today I basically
just sat on my fat butt and played Hollow Knight. It was pretty glorious. This
is truly an excellent game. Everything about it is rad, from the music and art,
the super tough boss fights, awesome character and set design, challenging jump
puzzles, mysterious plot, and incredible sound design.

Hilary had Yoga classes to teach early, so we got up and ran our morning
routine. Then Hil took off and I dug in to the Switch, not to emerge until
much much later in the day.

The downside is that outside of a bunch of progression on the game not really
much developed in my life today. I processed some email, and pushed some stuff
around the plate on the perf. Tomorrow will have to be focused on work, and
maybe some productivity on personal projects.

One last push, then I'm out of the woods.
