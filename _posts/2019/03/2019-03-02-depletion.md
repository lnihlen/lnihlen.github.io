Not much to say about today, if I'm honest. I popped over the hill in the rain
for a samba rehearsal. Then lunch at a busy spot, a run over to Whole Foods,
and sitting in the traffic to get back over the 17 after some weather-related
accidents.

Then I took a nap. I'm just totally spent from the past few weeks. I was running
on fumes yesterday and wasn't feeling any better today. It's pretty unusual for
me to nap but recent weekends napping has seemed completely natural and easy.

I worked a bit on [hid-osc](https://github.com/lnihlen/hid-osc), finishing
the OSC message logger and starting in on the HID side of it. I think next
up is to pair a WiiMote to may laptop and start trying to understand what kind
of signals come out of ```hidraw```. From there it's about designing a two-way
OSC API for talking to that device from SuperCollider.

Hilary came home from an all-day seminar and I made us pizza. We watched the
new RuPaul's Drag Race season 11 debut episode. Now we're sitting on the couch
watching old episodes of Chopped on TV on mute, and Hil is requresting different
Prince songs from the Google Assistant. I think I'm going to finish this blog
entry and go to bed.
