After waking up at 2am and being unable to fall back asleep I felt the best option was
to just try and power through the day in terms of the meetings that I absolutely had to
be there for, then go home as soon as I can and go to bed.

That was the plan and that was pretty much what happened. Kept myself afloat with coffee
and just tried to stay on "net/net adding value" side of meetings. I did manage to bug
out a bit early, arriving home shortly before 5, where I was off straight to bed.

Woke up again around 8. Hilary and I had made plans to go see Us tonight in Scotts Valley
but it just wasn't going to happen. After a bit of late dinner Hil and I watched the
latest RuPaul's Drag Race. I'm writing this blog, then back to bed.

Tomorrow is the last {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} concert of the season,
as part of the Linux Audio Conference, this year at CCRMA. I was reflecting that, in
a way, it feels very much like a full circle. Last August I came to CCRMA to take
that introductory class in SuperCollider, co-taught by Bruno, and here I am returning
to the same place to perform as part of Bruno's orchestra. It's an honor to do so,
and I'm excited to see where next this journey will take me.
