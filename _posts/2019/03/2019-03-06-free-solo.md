I think after this weekend, which I expect will be once again dominated by
either recovery from this work week or additional work, I can reasonably expect
that some equilibrium is likely to return to my work/life balance. At least
one can hope. In the interim we will have to settle for terse blog posts like
these, sort of an endless repetition of the same.

"What happened today?" "A bunch of work stuff, not relevant to a personal blog."

Hil put Free Solo on, that documentary that got some Oscar love, on while I
worked. I found it so captivating I eventually just folded up the laptop and
watched. Quite impressive, and the mountain is beautiful. I recommend it.

Tomorrow morning I have another fill-in at
{% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}. Still no real clarity around if I have
had that shift permanently assigned to me or not. Not a real big deal, I again
just worry about being expected to show up for a shift without signing up for
it, because the show has been awarded to me and I just didn't hear. To be fair
the station, there is a staff meeting every Wednesday evening where these kinds
of things are announced, but my schedule recently has kept me from being able
to attend it in person.

So one week at a time, for now.
