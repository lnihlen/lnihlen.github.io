So I got some feedback at work today that I should chill out on the cussing.
And I thought about it all the way home on the motorcycle road home. I've always
cussed at work. It's funny, typing it out and reading it, what a dumb idea it
looks like reading that back. But yeah, I curse at home, I curse when I'm
talking to my friends, why wouldn't I curse at work?

When I joined Google 2010 I joined a part of the company that is known for its
cowboy culture. Whiskey botles on desks, the boss had a private
[Four Loko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Loko) stash after they
reformulated. People cussed in meetings, in the hallways, at their desks, in
their code. So I cussed too, naturally.

There were a lot of things about that team that ultimately I found kind of
alienating. Cussing wasn't one of them. But I can imagine, if there was
somebody else on the team who wasn't as comfortable with cussing, that would
probably feel pretty alienating.

Honestly I think it's a way of distancing myself from others, keeping folks
a bit off balance in my presence, (underneath it all) a way of asserting my
power. *Look at me,* I'm saying, *I'm so entitled to be here that I can behave
unprofessionally and you have to put up with it.* Amateur hour tactics.

I honestly do value inclusion, psychological safety. I believe that more diverse
teams where people feel included and safe are better workplaces. And I try my
best to work towards that in all ways. Cussing has been a way of holding on
to some part of my non-corporate, non-conformist self concept. But it's time
for it to go.

To help break the habit Hilary recommended I just pretend I'm on the radio. To
that end, I've got another {% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %} show tomorrow
morning, so a good time to practice. And off to bed.
