Up at 4 for the drive in the dark over the hill to
[do radio](https://www.kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58775) at
{% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}. I was really stoked during the second
and third hour, which made it perhaps a bit more ok that the fourth hour didn't
come together as well as I would have liked.

It's definitely true that having a radio show, particularly a permanent airshift
with its work requirement, will take time out of my schedule for pursuing other
creative projects, like {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} or my
contributions to {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}.

But, listening back to the playback tonight while I was continuing on
work stuff, I genuinely enjoyed what was going on. It is a real treat to get the
exposure to the broad variety of noise artists you run across at KFJC, both old
loves like Torturing Nurse and some new-to-me folks like Circuit Wound, who
apparently has been around forever but I hadn't run across them myself before.

In related news, a work deadline for perf that I thought was tomorrow at the
latest is actually a week from Monday. So yeah for that. Going to go to bed
at a reasonable hour tonight, and just kinda grind through it all. I got a lot
done today, if I can keep that up for another week or so I think things might
start to get back to normal.

So yeah, not a terrible day. A bunch of gear showed up in the mail for the
ongoing field recording project. I want to identify a location for some
experimentation with all of the field recording gear, certainly before I take
off for that course in May. Given that perf season doesn't officially end until
end of April, basically only a few days ahead of the course, I'm going to need
to figure out how to fit both together.

Time to do some location scouting for interesting sonic environments. Fun!
