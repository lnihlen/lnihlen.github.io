I returned to CCRMA today for the final {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
performance of the season, at the Linux Audio Conference. Bruno had volunteered
to be the Laptop Orchestra for the conference, and we performed the single
accepted piece, a Wiimote-based work titled Florescent Nights.

It definitely felt like a completion of a circle, returning to CCRMA to perform
as part of Bruno's orchestra, after first having met him there last August when
I took his {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} weeklong intro
course, and asked if he might be interested in collaborating on some future
projects.

It was a full day, after waking to see Hilary off I had only about an hour to
kill before heading over the hill to Stanford, meeting the rest of the Orchestra,
loading in the gear and sound check. We had a short lunch and I grabbed a
bit of time to make some good headway on
{% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}, this time working on writing
some code instead of just design. I managed to get to a good place of getting
some Vulkan initialization and setup going. Probably another two or three
big chunks of work between me and lighting up any actual pixels. But I'm
going through the Vulkan tutorial and kind of flattening the code out into
a single file, with the intention of reorganizing it later once I've gained
some more insight in to how I want to organize the protocol between the
SuperCollider language and the graphics server.

We had a chance to run through the Florescent Nights peace with the composer
once or twice, then it was time for the performance. There was a packed house,
and the audience seemed receptive to what we on offer. This time was a full
hour of music, with the Florescent Nights piece first, followed by two SCLOrk
pieces.

I lucked out and ran into two of the primary authors of SuperCollider in modern
times, Nathan Ho and Brian Heim, and we chatted a bit about current state of SC
development. I'm a great admirer of their work, and the great lengths they have
gone to make newcomers to SC development like myself feel included. I was
surprised at how young they both seem, given the maturity they have
demonstrated on the project. It's a real pleasure to meet young professionals
in the software industry of such high caliber. Gives me hope for the future of
my craft.

Hil and I helped load out some, then headed over for a late dinner at Walia.
Now we're home and it's once again time for bed. Feeling like this wasn't
nearly enough weekend, I'm still really exhausted!

But it may have to suffice.
