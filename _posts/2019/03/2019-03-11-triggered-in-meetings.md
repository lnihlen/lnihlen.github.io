I'll spare you the grisly details but because of some painful personal
background, going back for a long time, I respond very poorly to
[gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). If you don't know that
term I'd recommend a read through some articles online about it. At least for
me, once I began to understand what gaslighting is, I saw it everywhere.

For a lot of people, gaslighting is their sole negotiating tactic. Like, they
are so uncomfortable with there being a disagreement, or a problem between
themselves and another, that they'd rather engage in some light gaslighting
in order to try and best pretend that there never was a disagreement, that
everything has always been running along the rails of this new history, this
alternate reality where we've always agreed with their thesis. I think it's a
pretty common parenting tactic, too, and a lot of people learn how to treat
others from how they are treated as children, so these patterns play on and on
throughout generations of human history.

It was not until a few years in to Google that I took
[a class](https://gettingmore.com/) on negotiation that I realized that I, like
so many other people, actually have almost no experience or skill in
negotiation. It's incredibly empowering to realize that not only is negotiation
a practical skill that can be learned and practiced, like playing the piano,
but also that *almost all human interaction is a negotiation.* It's helped
me so much at work to realize that almost any terms that I'm dealing with can
be negotiated. I've helped so many people through difficult organizational
challenges at work by reminding folks that *they can negotiate for what they
want.*

Two things advised in that basic negotiation book that have become central to
my whole way of relating to other people are that you should never negotiate
from a place of dishonesty or extreme emotion. People make terrible decisions
when they are emotional, and it is underhanded and dishonorable to manipulate
folks to become emotional in order to keep them off balance and get the
negotiation outcome that you want. Sure, you might win the short term, but
people remember those kinds of underhanded tactics and word will get around.
Besides, it's just plain wrong.

On the flip side, if you become aware that you are in a pretty emotional space
during a negotiation, the advice is to take a pause in the discussion and come
back once things are a bit cooled off. So what I've had to learn is that when
I'm having that emotional response to being gaslighted by someone who hasn't
learned how to negotiate effectively, I've got to end the meeting and walk
away. It feels rude, but I had to say it this morning: "folks, I'm pretty upset
about this situation right now, and I don't like making decisions when I'm
upset, so we're going to have to table this issue for the moment until I've
had a chance to collect myself."

Usually people get pretty freaked out by this and try to get me to push through
it. That never works. An old manager of mine once told me that he realized that
he needed to give me three hours to process any new information. Like, he would
tell me something, I would freak out and say a bunch of stupid stuff, then we
would part ways, then about three hours later he would ask me for my opinion
again, and I'd usually have something smart to say then. I'm a lot less reactive
these days, and I also can realize some of the time when I've flipped out. So
it's going to be three hours until I have something smart to say. Maybe that's
not great, at the pace that business wants to move a three hour delay for a
decision might be excessive. But that's how I role.

It takes a measure of control, to just straight up say "yeah I'm leaving this
meeting because ya'll have pissed me off and I don't make good decision when
I'm pissed." And then to get up and go, despite all the social pressure to like
stay and talk it through. But I'm trying to learn better exit strategies for
that situation, as well as always practicing on trying to keep my cool. With
the additional pressure of perf right now, that's not so easy. Hence, the
development of the alternative strategy and skills of realizing when I've
been triggered, and then bailing with minimal damage, if that's the last
resort. Not a skill I'm hoping to practice all the time, or even occasionally,
but good to have in the back pocket.
