Starting to feel less like a walking zombie and more like a regular human being
again today. Several discussions at work were actually fun! Then home to dinner
with Hilary, processed a few emails, and played Hollow Knight. I finally beat
one of the bosses that had really turned into a complete grind, the final
fight with Hornet. I like what a different play style each of the bosses
demands. With Hornet I wasn't able to win until I started playing almost
entirely defensively, just doing my best to avoid her varied attacks and
slowly wearing her down with the occasional swipe of my sword whenever she
passed into range and wasn't about to poke me with her needle.

I'm planning on taking a chunk of next week off, hoping to have some time just
to chill at home, work on {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}, maybe
play some more vidya games, and in general be a total slug. Hilary is going out
of town for a bit and I'm looking forward to having some time just to myself
in the house. It's fun for about a day, then I'm ready for it to be over and
for things to get back to normal. She'll be gone a bit longer than a day but
I do think having a much-longer-than-normal weekend could be pretty cool.

Look at me, already living in next week. Still a few more things to do between
then and now. But it feels good to be coming out of the woods. Or, at the same
time, getting used to the ever-present crushing anxiety that is coming from
not hearing the results of my promo until the end of April. Maybe a bit of
both?
