The {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} class at SCU is during Winter Quarter, which I
understand ended or is ending right around now. So after the highlight of last week's
performance at Dolby Labs most of the student part of the orchestra has packed it in. The
gear we normally use, which for all semester has been set up in the classroom ready for us
to use, was sitting in the packing containers used to transport the gear down from San
Francisco last Thursday evening.

We're performing at the Linux Audio Conference this Saturday, and then official SCLOrk
activites will be on hiatus for a little while, because the conductor Bruno is going
to be having a baby. There's some talk of a few of the members still meeting every
other Monday, and perhaps we'll formulate some plan about how best to use that time.

But for now, we're winding down what feels like a successful season of SCLOrk.

Perhaps in the time freed up I can make some real progress on the supporting
code, without having to worry about breaking up any of the upcoming performances.
This may also be a great time to make some progress on the various personal projects
I have largely deferred to prioritize SCLOrk, like Scintillator and Egregious. We
shall see. I think, at first, with both this and perf winding down, I'm going to
appreciate moving back to a slightly less frenzied pace of life.

At least for a week or so.
