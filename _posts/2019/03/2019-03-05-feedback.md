Another day dominated by perf at work. I dead lifted for the first time in a
while this morning during strength training, but for the balance of the day I
was filling out peer feedback or detailed manager notes supporting performance
ratings for folks on my team.

The rain once again compounded the traffic on the commute home, making it so
that once I arrived and ate dinner there was only time left for homework in
the evening.

I've been thinking about what systems or processes I could put in place and have
to rely on for the next time the stress and demands of my job exceed their usual
equilibrium.

I certainly miss running. Perhaps my search needn't range so far.
