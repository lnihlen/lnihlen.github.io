Up well before dawn for another 6a-10a
[shift](https://www.kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58925) at
{% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}. I get some time to chill during a noise
set like that so I actually made some good progress on
{% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}, getting through the swap chain
part of the Vulkan Tutorial and adapting it in to the different architecture
that I'm slowly building as I go.

Then off to work for the last round of big perf-related meetings of the season,
along with a few other organizational, planning, and personnel-related meetings
for a full day.

It feels surprising to be having fun at work, after such a long and stressful
slog, but today was that day. Perhaps it's because I'm going on vacation next
week but I think it's also that I'm through the worst of this current big wave
of fear around my own promotion, combined with the anxiety around the career
outcomes of the people on my team.

This has passed, and another perf cycle gone makes me feel like that perhaps,
with some more time and experience, they will get easier. Funny how quickly the
brain forgets the negative parts of an experience, but I'm glad to see that
working. Otherwise I'm not sure how I would ever get out of bed.

Hilary had done her own show later in the day today and we met for dinner
after. Then home, got a chance to do work-related homework on my cool new
Living Room desk. And then it was time for bed.

Tomorrow is a fairly routine workday, then home and I'm officially on vacay.
That'll be nice, even if I won't end up more than a 100 miles away from home
the whole week.

Wishing for sleep, hopefully lighting up some Scintillator pixels, some good
progress on SCLOrk, maybe grind some more on Hollow Knight, hell maybe even some
work on {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %}.
