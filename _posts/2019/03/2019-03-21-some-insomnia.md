Long day, followed by dinner then a healthy bit of homework. Ground for a
second on Hollow Knight. As you get better at that game, it gets bigger, which
exposes some significant variation in the level of challenge of the game from
moment to moment.

Then it was time for bed. Then suddenly around 2am I woke up. I realized that
I forgot to write anything for my blog, and also realized I wasn't going to be
able to fall back asleep.

I've got the Big Lebowski on and I'm typing this blog out one sentence at a time
between jokes. I might try to rack out again soon but I don't want to disturb
Hilary with attempts trying to fall back asleep.

Tomorrow (well in a few hours) is a big day, with a couple of pretty important
meetings. Wishing to find some peace.
