Today was one of the last days, hopefully, for this 6 month cycle that will
be dominated by perf. I had 4 major performance reviews to write, so after
our traditional Sunday breakfast of {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %}
waffles it was time to dig in.

And that was pretty much it for my Sunday. Grabbed maybe a half hour or so
in the late afternoon to play half hour of Hollow Knight on a break, and
managed to pick up the Crystal Heart in that game, opening up a couple of new
areas to explore.

But other than that it was grinding away on my argument to support promotion
for several of my team. Phrases like "outstanding," and "far above expectations,"
"outsize impact," "strong individual contributor," "leadership of self and
others," conspire to create a condition I name as Superlative Fatigue.

Strong incentive to continue to recruit managers to my team, so I can layer and
therefore have a smaller number of direct reports, which therefore in turn
reduces my perf workload, allowing me to focus on the few reports remaining,
and execute their perf at (hopefully) a higher quality.

Maybe for next season. For now I'm just glad to be putting this perf season to
bed.
