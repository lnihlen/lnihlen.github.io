Since I'll be out of pocket soon recovering from surgery I've been wanting to make sure that the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %} were situated adequately with sufficient food and water, as well as set up
the Nest cam (hah) that we had on them during their time in the brooder. I am aware, even if in only some very small
fashion, of the great deal of hard work that goes in to farming. I keep running out of time and energy to work further
on the chickens before I run out of work left to do. For instance, I got the electrical system up but that required
drilling a hole bigger than a wire in to the floor, to allow passage of the plug through to the exterior. But now there
is a hole in the floor not completely occupied by the cord, which could be a potential entryway for rodents, who are
perpetually interested in taking the poultry feed for themselves. So, that will be a project for the next time I have
a chunk of daylight and energy to spend on the birds.

Hilary and I are determined not to leave the house tomorrow, and I'm inspired to do a bunch of cooking, so after washing
all the chicken poo off we headed out for dinner, followed by a Whole Foods run. It didn't leave a lot of time left for
working on SuperCollider audio projects or anything but I'm glad I was able to get ourselves and the chickens situated
to survive the next few days comfortably and peaceably.
