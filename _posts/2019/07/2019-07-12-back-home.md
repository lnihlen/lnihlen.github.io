Was feeling well enough today to travel back home, a few days earlier than anticipated. It'll be good to rest in my own
bed for once. Still on recovery mode, although I did manage to spend some time on the flight back from Dallas working on
the asset sharing system for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. I was freaking out a bit because at first I
didn't remember any part of the code and I realized that it was over two months since I last touched that code. Golly
time flies! But after a short while of working with the code and reviewing the documentation I was able to get
productive again, although everything is still a bit fuzzy from the painkillers and anesthesia.

Hoping to ween off the painkillers over the next few days, clear up the head, and maybe make some headway on these
personal projects while resting and recovering, before the inevitable return to my work responsibilities. It's good to
be on the way back, as opposed to on the way in.
