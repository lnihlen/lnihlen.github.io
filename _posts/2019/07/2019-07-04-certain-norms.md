Spent a good deal of the holiday daytime cooking, which was fun. I made fried chicken and waffles with the new waffle
iron Hilary gave me as an anniversary present. I also made a pecan pie with the pie dough from scratch. I like making
pastry dough. I typically use the food processor to keep the handling to a minimum, I think this helps in keeping the
fat solid before the dough goes in to the oven. You have to be careful, though, because the food processor can overwork
the dough really quickly.

Nathan Ho, a lead developer on {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} and a nerd hero of mine set up his debut
stream of him livecoding on SuperCollider. I had thought it was Saturday morning for some reason, and only caught the
later half of it, but it was great! It was inspiring to see a master do their thing, and also very educational in that
I picked up a couple of stylistic tips and tricks that I think I can use in my own SC work.

Then it was time to turn my attention to the office for continuing some work on the Duffing oscillator. I was dismayed
to learn that the Mac Pro I have been using recently seems to be having major issues. Since I really didn't have the
time to fuss with it I just checked in what I had on the oscillator and plugged my Linux workstation back in to the
monitors.

It's a real pleasure to return to Linux, I have to say. I think my frustration with my Linux laptop may have had some
other frustrations mixed in to it, and perhaps it is fair to say that the laptop and desktop situations on computers
are very different. But this Linux workstation really kicks ass. Setup took only as long as I needed to plug it in and
turn it on.

I made some progress finishing up the build system for the Duffing UGen and started in looking at verification. The
MATLAB install on Gentoo was straightforward and seems to be working just fine. So I'll integrate a few different ODEs
with MATLAB, save the output, then build that in to a unit testing framework for the integrator. Perhaps tomorrow I'll
have more time during the day, but we shall see.

Good overall to be back in the Linux groove, though! Particularly because I wasn't sure how I would be able to afford
one of them fancy newfangled cheese grater Mac Pros.
