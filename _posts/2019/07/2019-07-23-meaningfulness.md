I remain deeply impacted by the [Deep Work](http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) book I mentioned yesterday. I
realize that I've become increasingly distracted, and somewhat dependent on that distraction. I also have been feeling
that yearning for more depth, more time to think deeply about both my professional and personal interests. This has
wide-ranging impact, from how I might want to structure my career going forward to choice of next cell phone. I sense
a tectonic shift in my values and thinking, or more like an alignment where I have words for things that I have long
felt or intuited but couldn't necessarily put into action.

How amazing it is, sometimes, to be given permission to feel a certain way. I'd like to think of myself as an
independent thinker but in truth I think much, if not all, of the wisdom I have accrued in this life comes from reading
the thoughts of others, or observing the behavior of those that I admire.

I am tinkering with the idea of starting a formal deep work practice, where I would get up early in the morning to
pursue a few hours of quiet intellectual work, possibly on things like {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} or my
own personal SuperCollider projects. I'm also looking at my habits, such as constantly browsing the news and social
media on my phone, and seeing how this preoccupation with distraction has invaded so many different aspects of my life.

I unilaterally reject the thesis of the value of multitasking, and am determined to cultivate a discipline where I
direct my focus wholly to the task at hand, even if that task is as simple as playing a video game or cooking dinner.
There are many connections here to mindfulness training, as well as other activities in my life that have long
resonated or seemed special to me, such as distance running and blacksmithing. My hat is off to Cal Newport, and am
excited and motivated to see what will unfold when I invest in the quality of my own thoughts.
