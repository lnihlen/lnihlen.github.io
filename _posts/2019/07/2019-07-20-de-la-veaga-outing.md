I think my little doggie Molly was about ready to blow up this morning. I was playing some XCOM2, after cooking
breakfast, and she just was zooming around the house, a ball of inconsolable pent-up energy. She, like me, has been
cooped up in the house since we came home from the surgery. I realized that I too hadn't really left the house, other
than to do a few errands and to go see thew new Lion King movie with Hilary.

So, we trucked down to De LaVeaga park with the doggies for a short hike. I still feel like I'm getting tired a bit more
easily than I should by these kinds of things but the stimulation of being out in the "big blue room" more than made up
for it.

Took a preliminary stab at digging in to refactoring and simplifying the Confab project for
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. It occurred to me that by abandoning the distributed architecture and going
back to a much more traditional client-server model. It means taking the Confab architecture itself and dividing into
two pieces, so I started in on that tonight.

Tomorrow is feeling special because it's my last day before returning to work, which means it feels like it's the last
day where my time is my own. So I think I'm going to continue my recovery practice of doing whatever the hell I feel
like doing.
