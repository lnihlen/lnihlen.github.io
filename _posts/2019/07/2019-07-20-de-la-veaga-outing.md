I think my little doggie Molly was about ready to blow up this morning. I was playing some XCOM2, after cooking
breakfast, and she just was zooming around the house, a ball of inconsolable pent-up energy. She, like me, has been
cooped up in the house since we came home from the surgery, and it was getting to be waay too long for the both of us.
So, we trucked down to De LaVeaga park with the doggies for a short hike. I still feel like I'm getting tired a bit more
easily than I should by these kinds of things but the stimulation of being out in the "big blue room" more than made up
for it.

Took a preliminary stab at digging in to refactoring and simplifying the Confab project for
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. It occurred to me that by abandoning the distributed architecture and going
back to a much more traditional client-server model I could make life a lot simpler for myself and solve most of the
tough design challenges I'm currently sweating. Turns out, just like with people, designing protocols for efficient
communication is a lot easier when roles are well-established, with clear lines of responsibility. It means taking the Confab source code itself and dividing into two pieces, so I started in on that tonight.

Tomorrow is feeling special because it's my last day before returning to work, which means it feels like it's the last
day where my time is my own. So I think I'm going to continue my recovery practice of doing whatever the hell I feel
like doing.
