Another rest and recovery day, getting tired of doing only that, but it seems to be consistent with where my energy
levels are right now. I spent some time playing Outer Wilds on the Xbox One. It's pretty entertaining, if frustrating at
times, particularly in my foggy state.

Hopes I had about returning to work early are vanishing quickly. I had thought at one point of returning as early as
tomorrow. That's clearly no longer an option. But maybe towards the end of the week my stuff will be together enough
that I could make some progress on SCLOrk code or something light like that.
