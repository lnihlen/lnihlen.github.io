I'm scheduled to return to work this coming Monday so, not counting the weekend, today is the last day I have off to
recover from my surgery. It was pretty unremarkable as a day, mostly spent resting and playing video games. I had hoped
to be more productive during this break but that's always the case, with every break that I take.

I think I'm going through a period of depression, brought about by work-related events as well as other personal life
issues. The signal for me that I'm depressed is always that I feel the good things in my life less, feel less
adventurous or interested in excitement. I notice a tendency to stick to old familiar patterns of behavior, and to
overeat.

I've struggled with periodic bouts of depression for my entire adult life. It's funny, I was just going to repeat my
story about the first time I realized I was depressed and in fact I had some vague memory of already telling this story
on my blog. Sure enough a quick grep of the blog reveals that is true, I talked about it
[last October]({% post_url 2018-10-25-vidya-games %}). In any event, that's going on again.

Recognizing that I'm bummed out is a good first step, at least. Maybe it's time to start running again? That usually
helps. As soon as my face stops hurting.
