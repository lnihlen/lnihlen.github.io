Had a bit of time today so I got to finish up the driven Duffing oscillator, my second ```UGen``` that I've written for
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}. Like its pure oscillator cousin, I have to say that I'm a bit
underwhelmed with initial explorations. There are hopefully some parameter "sweet spots" in there, and I'm very curious
about how the 8 Duffing oscillators that Tom Mudd wired up to make his album were actually wired up, because right now
the most interesting kind of sounds I'm getting out of there are vaguely reminiscent of a crappy digital spring reverb
emulation. The fancy integrator has been almost completely deprecated now, and the ```DuffingExt``` module I got working
today only supports the linear integration methodology.

I think I'm in a good stopping place for this, and since the medical stuff starts in earnest tomorrow my sense is that's
probably a good thing. Today was about kind of "battening down the hatches," as I think the phrase goes, getting some
stores set up to make staying in bed for a while a lot easier.

I played the first few levels of Shovel Knight today, along with a bit of Dead Cells. I don't think I'll ever be as good
at video games as some of the folks I see playing Dead Cells online, but I tried out a bit more 1 Boss Cell action and
while it's a huge step up in difficulty from normal play I was glad to see myself making it past the Concierge
consistently, which feels like some progress.

Looking forward to spending a lot more time with that game soon, although probably high enough on painkillers that I can
expect my performance to go down noticeably. Probably won't even notice, though!
