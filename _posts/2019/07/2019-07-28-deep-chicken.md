The carne adovada came to fruition this evening, after essentially cooking it all weekend long, and it was delicious,
although quite a bit more watery than I had been planning on. So we ate it as a soup and I made flour tortillas from
scratch and worked them in to quesadillas, as the adovada was too wet for a burrito. Still delicious, though. I'm
wondering if it will "tighten up" over night in the fridge, but regardless it's going over eggs tomorrow for breakfast,
because that is the absolute best way to eat red chile in my opinion.

Another project coming to fruition today was using a neural net to generate the names for the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, a la [ai weirdness](https://tmblr.co/ZP7VLs2jZXuQm). I followed in her
footsteps largely here,  using GPT-2-345M, a pre-packaged neural net system that is already trained on a giant chunk of
the English-language Internet, ready for fine-tuning on a list of inputs, in our case names of drag queens that Hilary
and I gathered. After fine-tuning the model overnight I ended up with a net that was happy to parrot back names of
existing drag queens back to me, my guess is that it was *overfit*. Training the model a bit less, then raising the
temperature a bit, produced some better results, from which I selected the following list of candidate names:

  * Herpetora Tofu
  * Abraham Lincoln
  * Hot Rosie
  * Thirty One Lordes

Hilary is going through the list right now to identify candidates, and I think we'll be working it down to 6 names in
the next few days. I had a lot of fun wrangling that neural net, there might be some more deep learning projects in my
future.
