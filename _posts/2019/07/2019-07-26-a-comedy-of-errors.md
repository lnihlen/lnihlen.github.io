In an interesting feeling of both "full circle" and "deja vu" Hilary and I attended another evening of Santa Cruz
Shakespeare, this time taking in the play *A Comedy of Errors*. I recall that was the subject of an
[early post]({% post_url 2018-08-31-shakespeare-in-the-park %}) on this blog. This play had a 1980s theme, sometimes
with the lighting and the neon-edged palm tree silhouette giving me the occasional Hotline Miami flashback.

I've been getting up at 5am to try and make a few hours each day for deep work, currently working on the C++ confab
implementation for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. Super glad I'm doing that but it means that by Friday night
I'm completely flattened, so it's time for bed. Hoping this weekend to make some serious time to double up on the 2-hour
deep working sessions I've been cramming in to the early hours of the morning.

It seems I can average about 200 lines of code per session, although I haven't been trying to get anything to compile
so far, I'm just roughing out code following the new design of the client-server architecture. So I have a feeling the
average rate is going to plummet to about 100 lines of code per working session. I really want to turn my attention back
to {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}. If I can get 100 lines of production-quality C++ code out per day
that means that it could take me around 168 days to get to the 16743 total lines of code in ```scsynth```. I imagine
Scintillator to be a similar level of effort, although I could probably get an early prototype working more quickly.

No time to waste!
