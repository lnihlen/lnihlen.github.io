Spent most of the day sleeping. My prescription for the post-operative painkillers ran out yesterday evening so I'm a
little more achy today but hopefully getting myself together slowly. I feel like recovery is in a series of stages,
coming back from the various surgical injuries, followed by the recovery from the drugs and their side effects, then
maybe recovery from recovery. But that's all happening, slowly.
