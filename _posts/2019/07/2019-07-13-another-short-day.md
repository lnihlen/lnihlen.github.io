I was hoping to have healed a bit more today where I could start digging in to more intellectual work but I figured out
pretty shortly after getting out of bed that I was still pretty out of it from surgery, and still in some pain.

I did manage to cook dinner, but other than that my creative output today was a net zero. Hilary found a cool show on
Netflix called Blown Away, which is a glass blowing competition show. We watched a bit of that together, and enjoyed it.
Hilary also ran a bunch of errands today getting our house back in order from our time away.

I played some different video games but nothing's grabbing me super hard at the moment. I think it's about resting and
recovering more then even being super involved in a game can allow. Think things will stay pretty thin around this blog
too for a bit longer, too.
