Today was occupied by either sitting around worrying about surgery or dealing with actual preliminaries for it. It's
amazing how counterproductive anxiety can be. Turns out there's going to be a bit more involved with tomorrow than what
we had been anticipating originally. So I'm anxiously downloading a couple of extra games on the Xbox One and getting
ready for a lot of downtime.

It still is supposed to be outpatient surgery, so we'll see what we'll see. Tomorrow, bright and early. For those
following along at home, nothing to worry about! Just may be light on material for a little while.
