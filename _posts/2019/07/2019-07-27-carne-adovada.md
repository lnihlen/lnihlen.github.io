Trying to be more focused in how I spend my free time, so this morning I made a list of goals for the weekend. I think
it was kind of an ambitious list, although I did manage to take the doggies to the beach and get started on the
[Carne Adovada](http://potrerotradingpost.com/Recipes/Adovada.html#) project. Since I'm eating meat currently this is on
the list of flavors from New Mexico that I've been craving. It started with ordering some sun-dried Chimayo red chile
powder from the actual town of Chimayo, New Mexico. This is an heirloom chile variety, that I've long known from my
times in New Mexico as special for its incredible flavor.

First was to start the red chile sauce, as well as get the slow cooker I picked up yesterday that turns out to need
tempering before actually cooking anything with it. I guess old-school slow cookers were discovered to leech all kinds
of crazy toxins into their food so the thing to do now is to get an organic clay slow cooker. These things are like the
cast iron of slow cookers, meaning of course that they first require tempering, and so I spent 3 hours this afternoon
overcooking rice into a slurry in order to prepare the cooker for the adovada.

Now the pork is marinating overnight in the chile sauce. I also picked up some fresh strawberries from a farm stand on
the way back from the beach, and to cool the heat from the chiles I think we'll have some home-made strawberry ice cream
too.

I also picked up a new toy for the {% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, a small ball with a few holes in it that
you put treats in to. They push the toy around and so treats fall out. We got dried meal worms for them to munch on. It
was a hit!

So it was a full day but I had fun.
