It has been apparent for some time now that pursuing promotion at work is a poor choice of life goals. Since it's not
directly under my control, and tends to be a lagging indicator of success at work, it's a recipe for frustration and
disappointment.

So where does that leave me? The rat race was turning me in to a rat. But a big change like a new career or a job
somewhere else all seem extreme. Starting a new hobby, going on a vacation, buying a new toy, all these things feel like
just distractions.

So now what? I've got some time, and am supposed to sit with the discomfort. Sunless Sea feels like the right video game
for this moment. Floating lost, without fuel in a lightless subterranean ocean, without fuel, drawing straws on eating
the crew.
