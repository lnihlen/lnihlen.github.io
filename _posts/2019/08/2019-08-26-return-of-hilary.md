Hilary returned home while I was at work today, which was lovely because it meant that I got come home to a house with
my wife in it instead of an empty one. She's done with her 500 hour Yoga certification, having finished her teacher
training at the Himalayan Institute. I'm proud of her for this achievement, it was no small amount of work, and I see
that she's built a relationship with a well-regarded institution in her field.

In unrelated news I took peek at Sunless Sea, because it looks like the sequel Sunless Sky is out and I wanted to dip
back in to it. This game have more of an interactive fiction component than I normally go for but the writing is
excellent and I enjoy the mysteries.

The clock is ticking down quickly on the next season of {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, so the time for this
kind of gallavanting around with video games is probably well past. But, keeping perspective on that this is my leisure
time, so I work on stuff when I want to work on this stuff. Hard to remember that with deadlines coming up, but if the
new crew has to use the old code, because the new stuff isn't ready yet, it's not the end of the world.
