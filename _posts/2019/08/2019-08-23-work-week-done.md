This one took it out of me but I was glad to get it done. The trip to New York has been productive, at least, but after
the day's meetings were done I wanted nothing more than a bit of room service, laptop, and bed. I figured out I could
install Steam on the Linux laptop, so I got a round or two of Dicey Dungeons in, and tapped a few keystrokes into the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} projects.

Tomorrow I'm home. I've downloaded a couple of new novels onto the iPad, and am hoping to luck out on in-seat power for
at least one of the two flights, giving me a chance to dig in a bit further on the chat refactor. I'm hoping to round
a corner soon on the chat rework, because I'm sensing there is going to be a fair bit of work on getting the
distribution of the client binary I've been building working well, and working on testing and stability. So the
finish work.
