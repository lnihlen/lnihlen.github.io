So I finished listening to the
[Good Boss, Bad Boss](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/good-boss-bad-boss-how-be-best-learn-worst)
audiobook on the way home. There's a lot of good advice in there but honestly the one sentence summary of the book was
starting to feel like "be perfect." On top of that I did an exit interview for a person on my team today and honestly
it's got me wondering just exactly how far apart my self concept as a manager is and the experience of actually being on
my team. There's an uncertainty factor in being a manager because you can't rely on candid feedback from folks on your
team. So, yeah, the combination of those two things had me doing kind of a painful personal inventory for the afternoon
and evening.

But a little sushi and some XCOM2 in the evening seemed to help. You have to trust yourself, I think. That doesn't mean
I can't make changes or learn or grow. You have to wonder, though, how much the rat race is going to turn you in to a
rat.
