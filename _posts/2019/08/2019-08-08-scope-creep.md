This morning I worked on finishing the lists feature for the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} asset sharing
system. To my surprise I was able to finish up the feature, including some basic testing, and then start in on the
refactor for the chat system. It's still feeling a bit grindy, and I started thinking along some other lines of systems
that I'd like to build. But, the system is coming together a bit, and it was moment to consider how to design software
using the new tools that I built.

I started looking for lights that we could plug into the USB ports on the SCLOrk laptops, to add a visual element to the
performance. I'm not sure that Bruno will be interested in that so I tossed him an email. But from a system setup and
status sort of perspective those kinds of things can be damn useful.

Looking forward to this weekend, I'm thinking I'll be able to really make some headway both on finishing XCOM 2 and this
SCLOrkChat rewrite.
