I think the hard-driving commitment to depth, while beneficial, is wearing me down a bit. The reason I think this is that
I overslept this morning so didn't have time for a deep working session. Then after work the guitarist from my old project
{% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} came over to pick up some gear he'd been storing here, and we got to talking
so it wasn't until late that I was able to start in on anything this evening, and not really in the mood for anything
outside of some more XCOM 2 grinding. I'm feeling like the end game is starting to come into view, with some tech tree
end states showing up.

So I played that for a minute until it was past bedtime, then laying down realized that I had forgotten to post anything here.
It's a bit late for another early rising but at least this time I've set my alarm. We'll see, long term, how I can make this
commitment to depth stick.
