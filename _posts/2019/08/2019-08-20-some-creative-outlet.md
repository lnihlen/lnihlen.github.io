I observed this morning that I'm feeling a continual low-grade frustration right now, which, after some further
introspection, I believe is due to the precipitous drop in creative output. Since I had been running myself ragged
getting up early to work I stopped that, but that meant that my hourly programming output went from 10 or more hours a
week to near zero during my recovery.

So I was careful to make time this evening to actually sit in my office and write some code, which felt good. As I think
about the various projects I have in flight for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} I'm starting to feel like the
finish work is going to take a while, although some of that can spill into the start of the season. It's good to bring
stuff to the orchestra when it's around 80% done, because it gives me a chance to get some early feedback and change the
direction of the code in the fine tuning without having to redo a bunch of the finish.

But there's a lot of stuff to land this season opening, and some of it on the more fundamental side of the technology
really does need to be pretty much done and stable. So I'm thinking I'll need to spend some time getting up the little
test orchestra setup I had going with a stack of Raspberry Pis running headless Gentoo. This should allow me to measure
the performance of the code I've written at some reasonable scale, provided the time required to get the test setup
going again is a reasonable bound. That will probably have to wait until the weekend, or maybe later, but it definitely
will come in handy I think to have that thing running as a test rig for a while going forward. I think there's some more
tuning and refinement to the distributed tempo clock needed, and the test environment is great for that as well.
