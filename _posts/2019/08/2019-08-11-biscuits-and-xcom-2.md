It'd been a while since I made biscuits for breakfast so I whipped them up today. Afterwards there was time for that
last half of the final XCOM 2 battle with the Elders. That completed, I started in on a fresh campaign of Mutant Year
Zero.

There was some time to dig in to the Asset sharing system work, this time finishing the key process detection. It's
useful to understand what computers are running the various parts of the SuperCollider runtime, including the IDE,
interpreter, server, and underlying audio routing program (```jackd```). On Linux we traverse the ```/proc``` directory
to parse the different entries looking at ```comm``` files with values equal to the names of the binaries in question.

This wasn't deep work, just sitting with the family on the couch and poking away at the code, for fun. With the deep
working sessions during the week I'm finding during the weekends I feel nothing but lassitude. But now the weekend is
done and tomorrow the cycle begins again.
