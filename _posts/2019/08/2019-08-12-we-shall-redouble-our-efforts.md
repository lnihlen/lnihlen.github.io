Had a little time after work, and Bruno was back on Santa Clara University campus to do some system administration work
on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} laptops, so I popped over there to visit and pick up an exemplar laptop
for the upcoming SCLOrk season. It was great to catch up with Bruno, and I was reminded of the fact that we now have
less than a month (!) until the start of the next season. In fact, I think first rehearsal is exactly four weeks from
today. So yeah, a lot of work left to do. I'll have to pare it down to a minimum viable product.

While I was working on that last paragraph I had another fun System76 laptop moment where the keyboard permanently
repeated on the delete key, eating a lot of the previous typing and then crashing into a black screen. Fortunately after
a reboot the laptop had a popup offer to upgrade the firmware on this laptop in order to solve that exact issue. Some
pretty cool timing, if I'm going to experience an awkward crash like that at least the reboot has a mitigation on the
offer.

A coupla reboots later and I was back in action. Good thing, given the context of the previous paragraph. For Linux
laptops I think System76 is as good as it gets, at least as far as I've experienced. I'm not in the market for a new
laptop but with their commitment to open source and rad customer service, I'll be getting my next one from them for
sure.
