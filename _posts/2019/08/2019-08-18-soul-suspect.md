The list of things I didn't get done this weekend feels much longer than the list of things I did. That aside, I did
spend a bit of time playing [Murdered: Soul Suspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdered:_Soul_Suspect) a now
five-year-old video game.

Hil made some time for a longer telephone conversation, so we got to catch up. But I think generally the theme recently
has been for me to think as little as possible, and both this blog entry and in fact this entire weekend is nicely in
keeping with that theme.
