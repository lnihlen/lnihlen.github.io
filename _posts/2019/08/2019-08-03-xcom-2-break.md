Well there were a few {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} development tasks that Nathan graciously
identified as possible things I could contribute to, as well as ample opportunity for deep working sessions on my
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} responsibilities. Instead I cooked us three meals, installed a swing for the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, and played a whole bunch of XCOM 2.

The chicken swing has little bells on the bottom of it. So while the chickens have yet to jump on the swing they are
already pecking on the bells. I think I'm super fried, so that was about the speed of my observations. Perhaps tomorrow
things will be more productive.
