Fortunately I was able to get the day off from work on short notice, allowing me to get up to Stanford campus and
scramble on preparing a 90 minute lecture on object-oriented programming, shortly before giving it. I felt like I was
throwing way too much information at people but overall the feedback was positive.

We broke for lunch after the lecture and then had a short wait while the students of the class prepared their
presentations. One year ago I was a student of this class myself, so it was an honor to be invited to participate again
this year. The presentations were excellent, with a few of them taking place in the 24-channel surround sound room
downstairs at the CCRMA facility. They really have some of the coolest toys.

After wrapping up the demos it was time for Hilary and I to leave, heading across the valley to downtown San Jose for a
running of the Wicked musical at the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts. Although the music wasn't my cup of tea
the Glenda actress stole the show with some great acting and physical comedy. 

Now home, a full day behind us, and ready for bed.
