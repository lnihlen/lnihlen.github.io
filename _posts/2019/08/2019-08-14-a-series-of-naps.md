I really think the sleep deprivation was catching up to me, and my manager came back from work sick this week. The
combination of these two had me sniffling and exhausted this morning, despite getting a few more hours of sleep than has
recently been typical. As a result after my morning work obligations I cleared my afternoon schedule and went home for a
nap.

After a rest, I did have a bit of time to start working on that patch for Pistache to copy the address of incoming
client requests. I managed to get the code written and started looking at how I might test it. Perhaps tomorrow I can
wrap it up.
