So the getting up at 5 to work for a few hours before work is becoming a bit of a struggle. I'm just too tired for the
rest of the day. I think it makes me a bit unfocused and cranky. But I'm torn because I really enjoy the time, and am
trying to accomplish a lot in various projects, and have so little time outside of that in which to work. But I really
can't last on 5.5 or 6 hours a night. I'm starting to feel like I'm living in a Kafka novel.

All that aside, I had a fun discussion this morning with the current "guest maintainer" of Pistache, the HTTP library
I'm using in the Confab application for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. I had a feature request, that I think
a few others have had as well, to be able to access the address of an incoming HTTP request to the server. This being
open source, I'm of course invited to submit a patch to the project for the feature I need. So that'll be another thing
on the list of stuff to work on.

And when that's happening I really can't say. But perhaps after a night's sleep things will seem less grim.
