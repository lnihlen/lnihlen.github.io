So I was struck by the feeling today, and this is likely an inaccurate statement but it's what I'm feeling at the
moment, that the most significant act I can perform to advance my career at Google in the moment is to wait. Of course,
I will need to continue to meet the responsibilities of my job and work to advance both the products and people in my
care, but those are acts of career *maintenance*, not necessarily advancement.

I am to wait. I'm not necessarily confident that this is inappropriate, or how I feel about it at all. It just is,
factual content, like water is wet. I think this period of time is deciding what is a genuine emotional response to
that. Not one borne of distraction or impatience, but what do I genuinely feel in my soul.

So I guess I'm waiting for that too, waiting to discover how I feel about waiting.
