So I had ordered a fresh pasta extruder last weekend and made shrimp scampi. This I would say was relatively successful
dish. The spaghetti noodles held together under the boil, and while they had stuck together some when coming from the
extruder the boil separated them nicely.

Hilary had requested homemade mac and cheese for this weekend, and in my overweening ambition I thought that the only
possible way I could improve a melange of heavy cream, butter, Gruy√®re and Cheddar would be to swap from the traditional
dried macaroni for fresh pasta. Because, like, fresh pasta is always better than dried pasta right? Well, that turned
out to be a bit of a mess, with a gummy lump of stuck-together pasta surrounded by a mass of delicious cheese sauce.

At Hilary's suggestion I was able to pull the gross lump of uncooked pasta out of the sauce, boil some dried noodles,
add them back into the sauce, and re-bake the dish. I had tried a lasagne earlier with fresh pasta, which was just ok
texture-wise. So I don't think I'll be doing that again.

Outside of a lot of cooking for only some little results, the only other productive output from today, if that can be
considered productive, was to finally make it all the way to the last half of the final mission of XCOM 2. So that'll be
a fun thing for tomorrow.
