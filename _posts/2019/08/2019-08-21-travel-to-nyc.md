Today was entirely dominated by a flight from San Jose to New York City by way of Salt Lake City. I had an early
presentation at work, then to the airport. Aside from sitting on the tarmac for over an hour after our arrival
the trip was uneventful.

I did enjoy a good amount of time to work on the Asset stuff for {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, and
made some progress there. I think I'm realizing that my idealistic design principles are going to have to bend
a little as they encounter the realities of user-facing software development. It's a bit of a painful process
but an important one if I ever want to finish anything. The pendulum is swinging back towards practicality and
results-oriented behavior, and not a moment too soon.

I'm in the Maritime Hotel in Chelsea, and it's just past 1:45am local time which sounds scary until you realize
it's not even 11pm back home. All well and good, until the alarm goes off tomorrow at a reasonable 7am, or 4am
California time. So maybe it's time to pack it in for the night. Modern travel is inconvenient, dehumanizing,
and decidedly uncomfortable, but at least there's an opportunity for some solid laptop time. So at least that's
something.
