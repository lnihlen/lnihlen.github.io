So with Hilary still gone I've been pulling double duty on the animal care and other household responsibilities. It's
fair to say that Hilary does normally carry more of the burden in household maintenance, and should I ever forget the
amount of work involved in that she can just go out of town for a few days for a great reminder.

In other news, while working through the gridlock in traffic I think I managed to finally break some of the gridlock
around the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} work. Not sure when I'll have the time to act on this but it's nice
to know what the next piece of code I want to write should actually do.

It's time for the evening round of medicines for the animals and then getting myself off to bed, for another glorious
day at work.
