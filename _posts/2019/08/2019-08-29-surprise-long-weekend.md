So this morning Bruno, the conductor of {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, sent an email asking me if I had
decided on what topic I was going to lecture on tomorrow at the SuperCollider workshop over at CCRMA. I knew that this
was on the horizon but quite frankly had forgotten that it was tomorrow! Fortunately my meeting load as planned for
Friday was light, so I was able to take the day off short notice.

Then I remembered that Monday is Labor Day, so all of a sudden I was wrapping up the work week, a day earlier than
expected when I left for work this morning, and looking at a 4 day weekend to boot! A pretty nice feeling indeed. At my
request Bruno picked the topic for tomorrow's lecture, I'm going to be talking about the class system and object
oriented programming within SuperCollider. So I'm organizing my thoughts as best I can, although I must admit that I'm
feeling underprepared.

Meanwhile, Grawer came over after work and we jammed a bit with his girlfriend Ariya, the first time playing the drums
for me in quite some time. Maybe 6 months on the drum kit? Maybe longer? It was really fun, making me realize how much
I've missed making that kind of music. Here's hoping we do it more often. And here's to the weekend!
