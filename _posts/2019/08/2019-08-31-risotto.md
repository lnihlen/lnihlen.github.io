After a Whole Foods run and some additional errands I started two cooking projects, both firsts for me, making a carrot
cake from scratch and also making risotto. I'd say both projects went went fairly well, with the exception of the
risotto flavoring. I don't cook with alcohol, so I swapped the cup of wine for an equal quantity of white wine vinegar,
which actually turned out to be a pretty terrible idea. So now we have a bunch of risotto with a lovely, buttery,
parmesan flavor locked into a death match with an overpowering vinegar note. It's somewhat edible, maybe?

At least the carrot cake came out great, although we don't have a cake stand so the cake is sitting on a turned over
baking dish, and I dressed it with a spatula, so it looks a bit homespun but came out quite tasty.

I advanced a few other personal projects a tiny bit today but nothing really of note.
