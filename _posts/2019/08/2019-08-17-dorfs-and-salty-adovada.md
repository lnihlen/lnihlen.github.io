With Hilary out I've been watching some YouTube videos to pass the time, which naturally (for me) includes watching
folks play Dwarf Fortress, a perennial fascination of mine, off and on, for somewhere only a bit shy of a decade now. So
of course today I rolled a new world and embarked.

I left the house to get groceries, with the intention that I could remain at home for the rest of the weekend. I was
thinking a second attempt at Carne Adovada, that traditional New Mexican recipe, was in order. There's an article in
[Cook's Illustrated](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/697-real-carne-adovada) sharing some research notes, if
not a formal recipe, that I referred to for this attempt. I dropped the onion from the last recipe, and braised the pork
instead of using a slow cooker.

The result was far too salty, I think I'll avoid the advice about salting the pork before-hand on the next iteration. I
do think the braising resulted in a superior product, and dropping the onion resulted in perhaps a simpler flavor but
certainly less liquid in the sauce as well, so an improvement overall. At least the results of experimenting while
cooking are edible, usually, although further iterations on this recipe will probably require me to order more dried red
chile. Not a bad side effect, all things considered.
