New York really is quite a distance from Los Angeles, where I'm currently winding down a layover for the short hop up to
San Jose. The flight wasn't terrible, in fact in some ways I think that seat was more comfortable then the seat over the
rare power outlet here in LAX that I'm protectively squatting over as I type this.

Of course, the in-seat power light was *on* on this seat, but blinked out the minute I plugged my laptop power supply in
to it. I suspect maybe there's an amperage limit that the power supply draw exceeded? That'll teach me to get a jumped
up Linux laptop. That portable netbook project I had been working on, running Gentoo and designed to basically last all
day on battery alone, is starting to feel like it might be working its way back up my priorities list, and quickly too.

I beginning to formulate the impression that I haven't quite got the whole laptops on airplanes thing entirely figured
out. There had been a minute where this had precipitated my brief return to the aging MacBook Pro but that was only
minute, the usability of that device really is pretty horrid, and now I'm not even sure I can bring it on an airplane,
thanks to the recent news about certain of those laptops being blacklisted.

For travel, I do think light weight and lengthy battery life trumps the higher power and graphical performance I usually
require from a computer. Working on this flight, I could literally watch the battery indicator drop every time I
recompiled the class library in SuperCollider, working on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} stuff.

Looking forward dearly to some peace and quiet tomorrow after the noise of travel and the big city.
