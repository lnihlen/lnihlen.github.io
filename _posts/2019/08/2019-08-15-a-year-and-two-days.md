I had thought that the anniversary of my beginning this blog was on the 18th, but when looking this morning I realized
that I had already passed the date, on August 14th. According to the handy-dandy combination of ```find``` and ```wc```,
this file is the 367th post, and in total the blog is currently just shy of 150,000 words.

It's been a useful exercise and I've learned a lot. For instance, I learned that the typical novel runs around 80,000
words, so much less than what I've written, at least in terms of quantity, although certainly not in terms of quality.
It does make me feel like a medium-to-large writing project could be within my grasp.

I'd like to keep writing, and keep up my committment to this blog, but as I think I've stated a bit earlier I'd like to
start working on more substantive, longer-form posts with more focused topics. But I am concerned about the possiblity
of just leaving the blog abandoned. So I'm thinking through about how I could productively capture this daily
discipline.

There's also some formatting changes, and hosting changes, I've been considering. I don't have any analytics on this
blog, because that wasn't the point. I'm sure most of these posts have been read by absolutely nobody, but it might be
useful to actually understand that. Plus a fresh coat of paint probably wouldn't hurt. If I recall from a year or so ago
(hah) I probably have spent a total of an hour styling this blog, in case it wasn't obvious.
