Not a ton of news about today. Things are kind of.. gray. Hilary is out of town this weekend, so it's very likely the next 48
hours or so will have very little, if any, human interaction for me. This is feeling like a very good thing at the present
moment.

Hoping to get some time this weekend to work on the SCLOrkChat refactor. There's still some open questions about what would
be useful to track online users and computers from moment to moment. Having a bit of quiet to think it through will doubtless
be beneficial.

Over the last few days I've had two separate gut-wrenching conversations with folks on my team who are in a very similar place
to me with their career situation. I'm finding it very difficult to be encouraging and upbeat in these situations when I
feel anything but about my own reality. It's a particulary draining conversation for me to have, even if it feels necessary.

Perhaps that's why I'm finding myself strangely delighted by the prospect of such an antisocial time.
