So it turns out that even though the idea I'm going through a mourning process about my recent setbacks at work seems
ridiculous, that doesn't seem to have any bearing on the reality of the emotions I'm experiencing. Thinking a feeling is
a foolish to have has no bearing on if you are feeling it or not, or perhaps it even increases one's burden. In the case
of this grief, because not only am I now processing the emotion, I'm also processing my own sense of shame around my
incredible privilege, to be feeling such discontent.

In terms of work I think I've been incredibly fortunate, overall. I'm privileged to work at one of the best tech
companies in the world, on a team that is caring and supportive, and on a project that I genuinely believe in and
actually use. Things in many ways are close to ideal. *And* right now I am mourning my failed promo attempt. Also, in
fact, I hear that failure is an important ingredient in a career. And that this is an opportunity to build resilience.
And it sucks. Perhaps all of these things can be true at once.

In less emo news I caught up with an old friend on Skype, and am also excitedly looking forward to picking up my Zero
motorcycle from service tomorrow morning, after they replaced the rear tire from a flat. So Hilary is going to drive me
over the hill tomorrow before work, quite graciously, and drop me at the dealership to pick it up. The bike's been out
of service for a minute so it'll be super fun to pop over to work on it.
