Today was a completely typical day. I met a landscaper this morning in order to get a quote for putting in a fence for
the garden I want to plant. Out here in the mountains if you don't put a fence around a garden it will be mowed down to
the stubs within 24 hours by the deer. They aren't the only threat, and I have a feeling that the garden, just like the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, will be an ongoing target of predation, in this case buy hungry herbivores.

Then off to work, for a full day of meetings, followed by dinner with Hilary at one of our favorite Ethiopian
restaurants. Then an old friend all the way back from high school (!) got in touch and we talked for a bit on the phone
while I drove home. Jesse and I go back now for longer than half our lives. We aren't great at keeping in touch but when
we do talk every couple of years it's like no time has really gone by, at least for me, he's one of those friends that
just doesn't fade.

I think it's been a few years since we last chatted and it really struck me how, at this particular age, it's easy to
let a year slip by without it feeling like a whole ton has changed or that really any time has passed at all. I know
this is something that I heard all the time from older folk when I was coming up and I know this is *yuuuge* cliche so
if you are rolling your eyes (whilst reading) right now you are totally forgiven but I am now experiencing the phenomena
of the passage of time in a profoundly different way than when I was younger.

A lot can change in a year, but if you zoom out the scale of time a bit a year isn't really that much time, I guess. On
a geologic scale a year is less than an instant. Perhaps that's something to bear in mind when feeling frustrated about
progression at work. On the time scale of a career, a year is not a great deal of time. It's just that I worry that I'll
be going through the same rationalization next year, and the year following. We do know how quickly these years pass.

Speaking of the passage of time and the turning of the Earth, tomorrow is the Garden of Memory! Heading for a half day
at work then up to Oakland for the event. Stoked!
