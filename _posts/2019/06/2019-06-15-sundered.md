Not much to say about today, spent it playing [Sundered](https://thunderlotusgames.com/sundered/). It's pretty
entertaining, once you kind of adjust to the timing of it. Things feel loose in the game in terms of control, or maybe
I'm used to games that vibrate the controller on every contact, so I had to learn how to identify the visual cues that
the game is giving me for contact.

The jump mechanic is a bit similar to many games, with a double jump and wall climb, but there's some interesting
mechanics around resetting the double jump by striking an enemy in-air. There was a cool part where they created a good
opportunity to climb a large open space by using the jumping/striking mechanic. Pretty fun.

Between the stuff at work and the {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} drama that's pretty much it for me
energetically. I did spend some time getting a new Kombucha brew going, and changed over the bedding for the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}.

Maybe tomorrow I can make some progress on the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} emoji work. This is going to be
an eventful week for SCLOrk, with a rehearsal on Monday night and the Garden of Memory gig on Friday. Or maybe I'll burn
the whole day playing Sundered again. That's the cool thing about a day off, maybe? Doing whatever the heck you want?
