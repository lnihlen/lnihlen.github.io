There was some additional discussion on the {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}
[psychological safety thread](https://www.listarc.bham.ac.uk/lists/sc-dev/msg59171.html),
so I spent a fair amount of time and a good deal more energy dealing with that, including some private follow-ups. I
think things are generally productive, although again not so confident what a single email thread can do,
good intentions or no.

Given that we have maybe 4 months or so until the eggs come in from our {% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, and
assuming we have all 6 hens that's probably a dozen eggs every few days. So I've been thinking about various ways to
advance my egg cookery skills. So this morning I thought I'd try my hand at Eggs Benedict. It was my first hollandaise
sauce, and while there were a few good looking recipes on the Internet I thought I'd go back to the OG classic and
pulled out my Julia Child cookbook. Gosh, that recipe uses a lot of butter! But it was delicious.

Hilary has graciously offered to help me get my studio together, and her first assessment is that we need storage
containers and places to put them. So it was agreed, after some negotiation to stop for meatballs for lunch, we headed
over the hill to IKEA. We got excited when we got there, about all the potential furniture pieces we could get, but
after walking through the whole damn store the only thing we left with were tables and bookshelves, which was what we
had come in for. It's so funny but the first couple weekend days of warm weather in the bay area are big shopping days
and this was no exception. Folks were out in force, and IKEA in East Palo Alto was quite overwhelming.

Then it was over to The Container Store over on Santana Row. Parking my truck there is always a bit hectic but I found a
spot on a surface street a block away and we hiked it in. It was my first time at that store but it's a favorite of
Hilary's. I have to say I was impressed. We got a bunch of storage options. Hopefully that will help tame my studio and
get it back to a more usable state.

We got home in the early evening and after unloading I think we both were pretty well spent. I unloaded the truck but
didn't really have the energy to build any of the IKEA furniture. Puttered around a bit, played some more Hollow
Knight, and the next thing you know it was time for bed.
