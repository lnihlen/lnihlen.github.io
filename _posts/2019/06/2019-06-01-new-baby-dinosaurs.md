This morning I dragged myself and Hilary out of bed extra early to get in to Scotts Valley, grab some breakfast at
Coffee Cat, and then get in line a bit early for the baby chicks at the [feed store](http://www.scottsvalleyfeed.com/).
The website had a lot of careful language about first-come, first-served, and advising to call ahead the Friday before
to check availability of the chicks. This lead me to believe that perhaps securing a few birds would be quite
competitive, so we got there early and prepared to wait in line.

But it turned out to be pretty chill, there was nobody in the lot except for a few employees setting up gear with only
20 minutes until open. So we waited around until the spot opened and were able to pick up 6 chicks:

  * 2 [Buff Orpingtons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpington_chicken)
  * 2 [Sliver-Laced Wyandottes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandotte_chicken)
  * 2 [Dominiques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_chicken)

We chatted with the salesperson a bit and it was clear she was quizzing us a bit to make sure we were going to be able
to adequately care for these animals. I'm a bit concerned myself, not that I think the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %} are in any kind of danger, I would not have gotten them. It's more that I
haven't had chickens since I was a middle school kid, and I certainly wasn't in the driver's seat back then, more like a
willing eater of many fresh eggs and occasional coop cleaner. But between my clarifying questions and also having
answered a few of her leading questions about our plan and ability to support these animals I think both of us were put
at ease.

So we got a cardboard box with some pine shavings in the bottom and 6 chicks, who we learned were born this most recent
Thursday, 30 May 2019. Also, interestingly, they were born in New Mexico, my state of origin, and airmailed out here
yesterday. The box was both surprisingly light and yet heavy with responsibility. We took them straight home, put them
under the heater, and they conked out until the afternoon, almost so motionless that I got a bit worried they weren't
well. But they're fine, after they woke up I put bird's beaks in the water and food supplies, which they seemed to catch
on to, and we have everybody now sleeping, eating, and drinking water successfully. So yay! I have a Nest Cam (haha) set
up pointed under the heater and am watching the birds again resting peacefully, as they hopefully will do so through the
night.

In unrelated news, Brian and team landed the huge reformatting PR to the {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}
C++ code base, and announced the lifting of the code freeze! It happened in the evening, so I was quick to test out the
rebasing script that can get any outstanding PRs past the "big merge." It's a little hairy getting all the tools set up
and everything, but after some help on the Slack channel and a few patches to the documentation looks like I was able to
take one of the simpler PRs through.

So, a couple of bumps, but it's in! Hopefully we can talk a bit about the future way to make these kind of big decisions
about the code base, so the next one isn't so emotionally draining and we can focus a bit more on the tech, a bit less
on the politics. With a developer conference call tomorrow, I'm sure that will be at the top of the agenda.
