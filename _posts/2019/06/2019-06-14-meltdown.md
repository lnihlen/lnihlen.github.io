I think things have been coming to a head, a bit at work, in combination with the emotional ups and downs of the psych
safety work on {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}, which had me in an impromptu session with my manager
this morning involving crying and other high drama. I'm feeling a bit stuck at Google, which is quite frankly
heartbreaking because I like every other part of my job outside of career trajectory.

I've been trying to shake it off, the whole not getting promoted thing, but it's not shaking. It feeds on me, a little,
kind of eating in to my overall sense of well-being. I think it boils down to a sense of not getting back from Google,
in terms of recognition, on the same level that I've been giving.

And always, with this, the overriding sense of self consciousness about how whiny this can sound, because of the
incredible privilege of working here in the first place. But employment here comes with a great deal of stress and
pressure, so yes things are great but also things are terrible in a way, high stress, high pressure, very competitive.
Things could be *a lot* worse, and in fact have been so for me at many other jobs.

But it continues to feed on me.

I got a kind followup email from my manager in the evening. Like I said, in almost all circumstances things are close to
ideal. Almost all.
