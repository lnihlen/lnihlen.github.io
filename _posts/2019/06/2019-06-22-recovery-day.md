After yesterday's long day both Hilary and I were feeling pretty wiped out today. After sleeping in we ordered Thai
delivery and looked at the fence for the garden that went up yesterday. It'll keep the deer off hopefully but not
much more.

For inspiration we headed over to a plant nursery in Scotts Valley and walked through. I was excited to see that they
had Ghost Pepper starters there! So now I'm dreaming of a salsa garden. Super fun!

Played a bit of a platformer called Feudal Alloy. After the smoothly animated 2D games I've been playing recently like
Dead Cells, Sundered, and Hollow Knight, Hilary remarked the clunky animation of the fish-robot main character is a
marked contrast. I'm not finding it particularly difficult, which is a nice thing for a day when I mostly just want to
chill.

I made pizza for dinner and we watched Vice, which was pretty good, if a good reminder of the dark times we now live in.
So all in all a restful day.
