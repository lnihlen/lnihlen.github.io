After close to a week of work and thought, on and off, I sent
[this email](https://www.listarc.bham.ac.uk/lists/sc-dev/msg59171.html) to the SuperCollider development community. That
was kind of the big event of the day, outside of the usual work stuff, and Ethiopian food date with Hilary.

It's been quiet so far but it's only been an hour or so.

Outside of that I attempted to update the firmware on the GPD Pocket 2, because there was some copy on the GPD website
talking about how the old BIOS version had some issues with the EFI boot shell. This is a symptom vaguely similar to
what I've been experiencing with the boot hang so I gave it a try. That required booting into Windows on the device,
which required completing the setup flow for Windows on the device. Then I noticed that the Windows system was reporting
not detecting a battery connected. So I took off the back panel and re-attached the battery connector, which seemed to
solve the problem. Then the BIOS update succeeded, but was a no-op in terms of solving the Ubuntu MATE boot problem.
While the MATE site does not mention this, there is some copy on the GPD site that the version of the Pocket 2 that I
bought is not yet supported. Somebody on Reddit was claiming that they got it to work anyway but that's not at all what
I'm seeing. My suspicion is that the combination of the boot menu not displaying, which is a known issue on the Pocket
2, is covering up a kernel panic or other critical boot failure.

There's a mention from GPD, just a short while ago that MATE support for the Pocket 2 model I have is coming "soon." So
perhaps that will resolve the issue. Windows on this device so far isn't terribly appealing to me, and if Ubuntu is not
working properly on this model of Pocket 2 I'm not optimistic I'm going to be able to make much substantive progress
with Gentoo, and not sure if I want to attempt either.

So maybe I'll download Steam and install some games, see what happens? Or there's always SuperCollider for Windows,
which I've been meaning to try out. Maybe.
