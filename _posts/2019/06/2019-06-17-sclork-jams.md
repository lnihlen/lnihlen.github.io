Although I was dreading going back to work from this weekend, and after kind of a grim outlook during my commute, work
didn't seem particularly bad. After a relatively humane day it was off a bit early to head over for an early dinner at
Crepes Bistro in Santa Clara, a pre-SCLOrk tradition for me, and then for the final SCLOrk rehearsal before the Garden
of Memory gig this Friday.

The rehearsal started a bit rough for me, if I'm honest, and I notice my headspace has been pretty dark and gnarly in
the last few days. I want to spend some time just practicing with the pieces we perform and using SuperCollider as an
*instrument*. I had a recent chat with SuperCollider developer Nathan and he was talking about his discipline in this
regard. He has been learning to *play* SuperCollider.

I'm always glad I came, though, and this evening was no exception. Friday's going to be a pretty special experience, I
think. And I really need to start in on that field recordings library!
