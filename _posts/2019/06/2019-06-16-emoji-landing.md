After a lengthy {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} developer conference call this morning, I was feeling a
bit more motivated to work on stuff, so I thought I'd tuck in and try to get that emoji support going for the SCLOrkChat
program. Given that there's a {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal tomorrow evening, and we have the
Garden of Memory show on Friday, I thought adding a feature that might compel folks to come over to the new repository
might be appropriate.

There's a lot of loose ends in the library right now, like documentation out of date and some unfinished features in the
major new additions. So lots of cleanup needed. I think the thing that's been missing is some actual user feedback, so
I'm glad to see the orchestra beginning to gather again, with some discussion around features both existing and planned.

Outside of that, I played some more of Sundered, as well as made spinach lasagna with noodles from scratch. Another
great part of egg cookery will be the fresh pasta I get to make with the eggs. Speaking of, the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %} are getting bigger every day, but they are really starting to *stink!* I'm
looking forward to the delivery of the coop, and I Hilary and I are talking about making sure the electrical system is
set up for the coop so that we could power some heating elements, and potentially move the birds out there at 4 weeks.

Back to work all too soon tomorrow but this weekend, while not exactly productive, has certainly been at least somewhat
restful. We'll have to see how it feels commuting tomorrow, really I think it could go either way.
