Late getting back from Seattle, so home by 2:30 this morning, in bed by 3, then up again at 7:30 am to start the day. I did make some good progress on the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} emoji picker on the flight home, at least. Settling on a context menu with lazily constructed submenus for descent
into the emjoi description phrase Trie.

"Because Tired" is a pretty good explanation of almost everything in the day. Probably a bit emo at work, and slow to put thoughts together. Ate a bit much for dinner.
A bit impatient with others. I went and got new eye glasses and I think I'm adjusting to the prescription but then sometimes I'm feeling some heavy eyestrain,
particularly in my left (dominant) eye, so things are blurry.

Took a dinner date with Hilary and was falling asleep on the way home. So yeah it's time for bed. Fortunately tomorrow is a later start. *Because tired.*
