Tonight I've lost sleep over Andy Farnell's excellent textbook "Designing Sound," which has an extensive array of sound
design exercises in it. In fact, after some introductory material it seems that the lion's share of the material is
devoted to these exercises. The book relies on Pure Data for the examples but I of course am implementing them in {%
include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}. This has already been done, of course, by many others and there is a
[WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Designing_Sound_in_SuperCollider) with several of the practicals implemented in
SuperCollider but of course the point is to learn by doing from these practicals so I'm doing my best not to cheat and
look at the WikiBook until after I've had my own crack at them.

I got through the first (trivial) one, a UK government standard tone to indicate a street crossing, which is a pulsing
2.5 KHz sine wave. As I didn't have a ton of time tonight I wasn't able to finish the second exercise, which was to
approximate different signal tones from the phone, such as a dial, busy, and ring tone. This was fascinating to hear
these iconic sounds coming out of my computer speakers. What is probably super obvious to many people, but these sounds
have powerful informational content and yet can be constructed with only a few unit generators.

Thursdays are long days away from home typically and so that was all I was able to get to. Looking forward to this
weekend, when hopefully I'll have some time to go much deeper in to some of these topics! After the conclusion last
night that I need more music theory I think I was extra motivated to dig in more to the sound design side of things. But
a quick search on the 'net about basic composition has yielded a rich vein of literature and websites to mine, so I
imagine I'll be swinging my attention back to that all too soon.
