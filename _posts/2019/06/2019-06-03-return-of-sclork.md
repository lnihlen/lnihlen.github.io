After a relatively chill workday (aside from a very early confcall with Zurich office) I joined the first {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
rehearsal in a while. Bruno, the conductor, has been out on Paternity leave, returning today. While Edmund, a senior member of the group,
helped guide a few ensemble members to a successful performance while Bruno was out, I wasn't able to attend as I was overseas during both
rehearsal time and performance. So this evening was the first gathering of the whole ensemble since we all parted ways after the performance
at Dolby Labs, which is feeling like quite some time ago (Feb 27th!)

I made a summary of the different projects I had been working on in the interim for SCLOrk, including the Asset sharing system, the addition
of emoji to SCLOrkChat, and others. It's actually piled up to quite a bit of work! And all of it about 75% complete, or right about where I
would want to bring it to a rehearsal for some feedback and preliminary testing. While I don't think we'll be able to land any major new
features for the upcoming Garden of Memory gig it was reassuring to hear that Bruno was comfortable with the development of all of the
different initiatives and looks forwards to seeing them land in the [SCLOrkTools Quark](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkTools). So that's
a big shot in the arm for all of those projects, and they will probably be bubbling up toward the top of the stack shortly.

We made some improvised music together using SuperCollider, and I was struck about how infrequently I am using SC to make sounds currently,
and how that's really the whole point of that programming language. So it was a pleasure to just tinker with sound for a while, listening
to others do the same and bringing some of my own concepts to fruition. More of that, please!

It really is a special group and it's such a pleasure and priviledge to have the gang back together.
