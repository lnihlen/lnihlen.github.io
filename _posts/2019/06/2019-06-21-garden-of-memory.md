I had a few meetings in the morning that it was probably better for me to attend so I popped up to Google for that.
Meanwhile at home we had a person building a lightweight garden fence for some raised beds I've got planned, as well as
the electrician re-doing some of the wiring that will be supporting the coop for the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}. It was a chaotic but fun morning getting all of that going, and then heading
over the hill for work.

Meetings done, Hilary met me for lunch and we took the long drive together up to The Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland. It
was both our first time up there and we had no idea what to expect. It's a columbarium, so think long hallways with
stone walls where the ashes of dead folk are interned.

The space is amazing. It looks a bit like a church and collection of supporting buildings from outside, but from inside
it's this huge multi-level connected space, packed with beautiful sculpture, stonework, stained glass, and memorials.
And, once a year on the summer solstice they open the building to an army of musicians who occupy every corner of this
extraordinary building and perform ambient and experimental music to the public.

Folks from {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} started to arrive and we spent some time setting up the gear and
getting ready for the show. We were sharing the space with another band, so the plan was they would go for an hour, then
us, then they would get another hour, then we would wrap it up with the final hour.

This ended up being a great arrangement because there was time between sets to wander the space and take in all of
the other incredible artists. My buddy Jesse showed up to see us and we had a good time wandering around the space
with Hilary, taking it all in.

Our sets were fun, we did a piece using contact mics processed by SuperCollider first, then after the break followed it
up with the improvised live coding piece that we typically do at all of our concerts. Folks walked through the space
for both pieces, with a lot of people sneaking peeks at our laptop screens to see what we were up to. Because we're not
playing traditional instruments I think there was some confusion about who was performers and what exactly we were
doing.

We wrapped up at 9pm, packed up. Then Hilary and I started the long trip back down to Santa Cruz, stopping first at work
to pick up her car (and grab a late bite at In N' Out) and then home.

It's the end of the SCLOrk season, with likely not even another rehearsal planned until August at the earliest. I'm
hoping that I'll still take some time to improvise my own SuperCollider pieces, continuing to work on my skills with
live coding audio performances. There's also a ton of projects going on for the next season of SCLOrk, so there's some
time here for a rest but also lots to do, as always. But all in all it's been a glorious season.
