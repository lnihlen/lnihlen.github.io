So I had ordered the chicken coop on Amazon, like you do, and it really needs to go up this weekend. The
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %} are getting bigger and stinkier and the brooder isn't enough room for them
any more. As the coop is on the larger side we were told to expect a delivery from a trucking company, that would
contact us to arrange delivery. Today was supposed to be that day, but when the driver arrived in the delivery truck
they determined that there was no way they were going to be able to get up our sketchy mountain driveway, or possibly
turn around after the completing the delivery.

So, I negotiated with the company to pick up the coop from their warehouse in Salinas, CA, a little over an hour's drive
to the south of our home in the Santa Cruz Mountains. And, since the choice was between picking it up this evening or
very early tomorrow morning, after dinner Hilary and I hopped into the pickup truck and headed south.

I ordered a wooden coop and a large metal cage for a chicken run. We're concerned about predation from owls and hawks,
so hence the cage instead of just a fence. The cage is in a large, flat box that seems significantly heavier than the
coop, yet was placed on top of the coop and only loosely attached with tie downs. So, of course, the first turn I take I
can see the box with the fence sliding all over the top of the box with the coop. I had to pull over and apply every tie
down in the truck to get it to feel secure.

Then it was a slow drive back to the house with one eye on the road in front and one eye on the side mirrors trying to
catch a peek at the load, which fortunately was relatively stable for the rest of the trip home. We got back just before
dark, which thanks to the long days was maybe 15 minutes until 9pm.

I think the plan is to let it sit in the truck until we have both available daylight and time to unload it in pieces,
then carry those pieces to the area where we want to set up the coop.

There was still time to practice some computer music so I got a decent jam going, learning more about proxies for both
patterns as well as connecting them to ```SynthDefs``` that I can change on the fly. I do think that right now listening
to me figure all this stuff out would probably not be super fun but I'm at least having fun listening to myself. I'm
also thinking I should probably learn some more music theory, particularly in the area of composition, if I'm planning
on constructing more interesting melodies. But it was still fun!
