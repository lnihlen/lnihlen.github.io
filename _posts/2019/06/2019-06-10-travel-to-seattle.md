When I left for work this morning I wasn't entirely confident in the plan, but there had been at least some tentative
discussion around me catching a plane up to Seattle after work, to attend the first day of a recruiting conference. I've
been asked to speak on a panel about the challenges of recruiting engineering managers specifically. While I have
represented Google before in certain business-to-business discussions, usually very centered around Engineering, this is
the first larger professional context for that, and I'm a bit excited/nervous.

It was arranged on very last-minute kind of basis, hence the ambiguity around travel. But, sure enough, as soon as I got
through the commute and glanced at my work email in the office I had confirmation of the flight up here. Then was a busy
work day and it was literally only when I was driving to the airport after work, talking on the phone with Hilary, when
she started asking me smart questions about things like where I was staying the night, and how I planned to get there. I
realized then that I had basically no idea about where the conference was, if hotel arrangements had been made for me or
if I was expected to make them myself. So yay for planning! Turns out, yes, I'm covered, currently typing away happily
from my hotel room. My conclusion is that Hilary + Google have completely spoiled me for travel planning. When traveling
with Hilary she always takes care of those kinds of particular details, and although Google has you book your own travel
arrangements they have a software tool that reminds you to book all of these things and kind of organizes it in a way
where you just sort of click through and then *wammo!* you've got an itinerary.

So it was touch and go there for a minute but seems to have sorted itself all out.

I still am not entirely confident what the schedule is like for tomorrow, but searching back through my email again and
it turns out there's some fine print, I'm expected at a dress rehearsal for one of the segments I'm presenting in
tomorrow morning at 7:30am. So ouch. Given that I didn't even get into the hotel room until just before 11pm I think
it's time to eat a few slices of this kale pesto flatbread, guzzle down the sparkling water, and call it a night.
