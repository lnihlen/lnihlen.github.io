Bit of everything today, with several different projects in various stages plus the
{% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %}, and a {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} developer meeting. We
hadn't had any developer meetings for quite some time so while I'm happy to see them resuming I'm hoping that if we hit
a weekly cadence that the time commitment will eventually settle down. Last week's call was 2+ hours, and this one
weighed in around 1.5 hours.

Since we unfroze the code yesterday and started merging PRs there was some discussion around moving forward with the
latest 3.10 branch, along with some other tactical topics, but we largely were talking about how to move forward with
making bigger decisions about the project. I shared my "decisions are the limiting reagent of any software project"
quip, along with some observations that I think right now the sc-dev community is dealing with some issues surrounding
low [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety). The problem with this is that there
aren't any quick fixes. Trust is something that takes a great deal of time to build, and decays so quickly when broken.
Psych saftey is trust in a way, trust that folks can be vulnerable without getting disrespected or abused. And, in fact,
asking folks to trust that the sc-dev community is going to be respectful at all times is probably not wise, at this
point.

So I'm trying to give some thought about how I could best support a change in the right direction. It's not feeling
particularly likely that I, as a single individual, will be able to make much of a difference but perhaps every little
bit helps. I also notice that I, in record-breaking time (faster than ever, in fact) have already started to move in an
engineering management direction on this project, as far as trying to look after some of the emotional aspects of
things. I think I should work on my boundaries a bit. I don't mind doing the emotional labor for this team right now,
but I'd like to have more conscious control over these kinds of patterns. I have other ways of contributing to a project
than amateur therapist. I'm actually a pretty good programmer, for example!

But all this SuperCollider work, on top of my return to work, had me pretty well fried. So while I cleaned a few things
up I mostly sat on the couch and played Hollow Knight. I had restarted it on the Xbox but now I'm getting back to the
part of the game that I hadn't really enjoyed on the first playthrough, which is super hard grind on various boss
fights. Some of them feel like it's not even close, like I don't even see them sweating before they wipe me out. I've
gone through a lot of the game to upgrade my character to make it as powerful as I can, like I maxed out my nail and I
have all but one of the masks, but still nothing on some of these fights.

Tomorrow evening we have a {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal, my first in quite some time! While I have
not finished the emoji work I'm hoping to get the group migrated over to the new
[SCLOrkTools](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkTools) Quark that has everything consolidated into one place, so
development can continue from there. I'm looking forward to seeing Bruno and the gang again, it's been so long!
