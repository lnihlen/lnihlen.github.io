Hilary graciously drove me over the hill way early in the morning so that I could pick up my Zero motorcycle from
service. It was there over the weekend as the service team suggesting getting a new front tire for it as well as
replacing the rear, as the rear had a nail through it. I think I got about 5000 miles out of those tires, which is
pretty darn good for sport tier on a performance motorcycle.

It had been a minute since I had ridden the Zero, and the short ride over to work was exciting but it wasn't until I
rode home from work, relatively late and so relatively free of traffic, that I truly felt like I reconnected with that
motorcycle. And it was glorious.

I think the quiet is really a big deal. It's kind of a dog whistle for who rides motorcycles and who doesn't, because
folks that don't ride inevitably express concerns around the risks of not being heard by the car drivers around you. I
think motorcyclists have already internalized the reality that nobody in a car is paying attention enough to hear you
even on a very loud motorcycle, or at least only a fool assumes that the car drivers around them are paying attention,
and so see the quiet of an electric motorcycle as a potential appeal.

I'm thinking I may have discussed this earlier talking about the Harley LiveWire, which (I am told) can play back
artificial engine sounds, which to me is actually an *anti* feature. With the quiet and the smooth-as-silk acceleration
I think the Zero is the closest thing one can get to the hoverbikes featured in Star Wars. It's just all speed and the
sound of the wind. But calling it a hoverbike experience isn't it either, because without the engine rattling around by
powering the real wheel with a series of tiny explosions the connection you feel to the two tiny patches of traction
that is the motorcycle's stance is very real and present. The Earth and the terrain are very present on a Zero, making
the bike feel very predictable and stable in most circumstances.

So yeah, it's love again for me and that bike. I think it will be a main feature of my commute for the next little
while.
