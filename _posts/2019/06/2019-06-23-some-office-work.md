Finally felt some motivation today to knuckle down for a few hours and get the office setup a bit more workable. Hilary
had graciously helped clean up some of the mess a few weeks ago so I was able to actually be productive and get some
things plugged in and configured today. I've moved my desk setup around and stripped it down again to just one computer
plugged in to the monitors I have. The goal/dream is to start really working on improvised performance based in
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}.

The morning started with the SuperCollider developers conference call, which we always seem to try to keep to an hour
but it still usually runs much closer to two. Then it was time to tackle the office space. Of course, while setting up
the computer I also was reminded of all that neat modular synth gear I have laying around, so I think some time will
also go to getting a synth rack up and running for some more exploration and experimentation there too. I want this room
to be dedicated to making sounds, and that's it.

Hil had mentioned a desire to eat peas, carrots, and potatoes in a dish so I found a recipe for vegetarian pot pie
online and did it up. It was my first experience using frozen puff pastry. I think for filo dough the frozen option is
the only way to go. The puff worked out great and I was able to make dinner in under an hour but I do think for fancier
meals making puff pastry from scratch would be a fun thing to try. Now that I'm not eating vegan I gotta say that it
opens up a lot of options for new meals, particularly with baking.

Before I go down for the night I do want to spend some time making some sounds with SuperCollider so I'll keep this
short. I am glad to be feeling a bit of a creative defrost, thanks probably to the combined effect of the winding down
of the psych safety thread on sc-dev as well as the inspiration of the Garden of Memory show this last Friday, as well
as (hopefully) some healing at work.
