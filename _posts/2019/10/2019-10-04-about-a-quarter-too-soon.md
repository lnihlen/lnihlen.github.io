Hilary has found a pop-up dumpling restaurant in Santa Cruz, Full Steam Dumplings, so we went to get our dumpling on
this evening for dinner. It was amazing. We're going to have to follow that place around town to get more. Not only did
they have epic gyoza and bao they also had spicy garlic ramen, super good.

Then we got home and I had a few hours to sink in to Borderlands 3. I didn't give up playing the game, because it is
fun, and I don't want to promise anything, but my inclination is to wait for a quarter or so, perhaps until the Google
winter break, before I really dig back in to this game. There's just too many bugs and weird imbalances for the game to
be much fun right now. Most battles are perhaps a bit easy, but then some will spawn a few badass enemies and to even
come in to their line of sight means instant death. Plus I got bit with some very odd UI bugs, making selection of
skills after level up, or (even more maddening), selection of weapons and inventory management just impossible.

There are no quality of life improvements in this game, meaning things like inventory management by categories, or
multiple quest waypoints on the map at the same time. I'm not expecting any of those things, even in the long term. The
previous Borderlands games never had them. You learn to live without. But what I think that means is that what is there,
like the simple backpack interface, has to work flawlessly. Not so, right now, which makes the antiquated approach to
the rest of the game design even more annoying.

If my video game jag continues, I think it's time to roll back on over to Diablo 3. But who knows, tomorrow may find me
grinding away on BL3 even more, major usability issues and all. Addiction ain't pretty.
