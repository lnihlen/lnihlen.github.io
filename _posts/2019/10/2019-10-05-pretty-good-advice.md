The very first friend I made when I joined Google 9 years ego was Josh, and we've kept in touch this whole time. We've
both gotten married since back then, so perhaps don't hang out on the weekends as much as we once did, but today Josh
and his wife Grace joined us for lunch at a local eatery in Soquel named Pretty Good Advice.

We haven't gone out for lunch with anyone in a while, so it was fun. Then we did our Whole Foods run for the weekend,
and I spent the evening cooking up [Carbonara Lasagna](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/carbonara-lasagna), a recipe
Hilary found. It was delicious.

I discovered that Borderlands 3 is much more stable and playable on the Xbox, so moved over there and spent a few hours
playing back to the same location I was on the PC, but enjoying it much more thoroughly. Planning to probably spend a
bit more time on that tomorrow as well. There also a new season of Great British Bake Off on Netflix, so we're working
our way through that right now. Good relaxing times this evening.
