Today was an all-day meeting at work, but in the middle of the day we had a surprise salsa dancing lesson, as a team
building exercise. Although I've been keeping up with strength training, and falling behind on cardio, it's been a while
since I had to move my body in any kind of coordinated fashion. It was a pleasant experience to reconnect with my body
that way. I thinking of asking Hilary if she'd like to take some dancing lessons together or something. Definitely the
most enjoyable "team building" thing I've done at Google in a long time, if not ever.

I got back the negative scans from the photo development service of the photos that I took over at Heron Point the other
weekend. I need to learn how to load my color film a bit more reliably but overall I'm pretty happy with the images that
came back. I want to return anyway, hopefully on a less windy day, for more field recording work, so perhaps taking some
additional images could work in to that trip too.
