I dipped in to YouTube yesterday and realized that Borderlands 3 has been out for a few weeks. I think because it hasn't
been released on Steam it's just been completely off my radar. Borderlands 1 and 2 were both 100 hour+ games for me,
according to Steam. I guess this one of those Epic Games exclusives, just like another game that I had pre-ordered way
back when I thought it *would* be on Steam, Phoenix Point.

I don't feel any special loyalty to Steam, other than that I own a few hundred games on that platform so I look for
things there first, just to keep everything in one place as much as possible. But I think Diablo 3 already broke me of
that, and so the combination of the two games on Epic was enough for me to download the installer this evening when I
got home from work.

One thing I will observe from Steam is that while its design feels quite dated (although I hear there's a redesign in
the works) everything that you would need from a video game store is there and it works. Epic feels kind of empty, in
comparison, with large poster art and comparatively few games. Plus I have to figure out where all the functions are
like how to install a thing and how to find other things. But, all that "it's not Steam" griping aside, I *was* able to
find Borderlands 3, purchase it, and install it on my computer without issue.

I think the [Rock Paper Shotgun review](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/09/16/borderlands-3-review/) is pretty
fair, in that it's saying it's very much more of the same from Borderlands 2. Not that that's a bad thing, but I knew
exactly what I was getting in to. And that's what I got. I spent maybe an hour with FL4K, the hunter-style pet class,
and had a pretty good time.

It's another sort of undemanding game that really works for me right now. I've got to see what loot will drop from the
next mob. That Skinner Box is just so satisfying.
