So PG&E, the local utility monopoly here in California, has been threatening to turn our power off because of fire
danger due to high winds. This is unambiguously better than starting a fire that
[burned down a town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_%282018%29). Of course, the outage website is down,
probably swamped with local traffic. Hopefully not tempting fate, but we were warned about these high winds and the
power outage but neither wind nor power failure has arrived.

I hear many throughout our home state are without power, with some estimates as high as 750,000 homes. That has to be
disruptive, and for some probably even dangerous. Living here in the mountains, loss of power is if not common at least
not uncommon, so most folks up here get a generator sooner or later. But so far we haven't needed it.

There was even time left over to watch a bit more of the British Bake Off latest season, with dessert week. But above
all this is a thoroughly tedious and uneventful day, which is my enormous privilege and good fortune to experience, with
a continuous flow of electricity. Hoping tomorrow the same, for all my fellow Californians.
