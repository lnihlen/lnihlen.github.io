I took a class on negotiations a few years back at work, using the [Getting More](https://gettingmore.com/) textbook and
working through a few exercises with classmates. I have to say the corporate training has been a bit hit-and-miss but
this course was incredible. One of the fundamentals I learned there was that negotiation is a skill, like any other,
meaning that it can be studied, practiced, and developed. The other thing I learned is that I, like many other folks in
the class, have almost no experience in successfully conducting negotiations.

I really didn't learn anything about negotiation as a kid. In my house I think generally the way of conflict resolution
was to brow-beat folks into submission and then gaslight them about it relentlessly until the issue was dropped. A little
dark, but in fact my findings are most folks have developed a couple of go-to abusive tactics for conflict resolution,
and outside of the usual tactic of repetition/rephrasing of their argument those are their only options.

Since taking that course, and following the advice in the book, I've been developing my skills around negotiations. And
while I'm a *super long* way away from any kind of Picard level of skill, I've noticed that I really enjoy working
through negotiations with folks, and also as I've come to enjoy it I've found that this kind of work is slowly becoming
a larger part of my job.

There were a couple of tense ones today, and I'm hopeful that they came out pretty well. I followed up privately with a
bunch of different folks about it and everyone seemed mostly satisfied, so I think we're doing ok.
