I think right now issues at work and the ongoing U.S. political situation, which I'm monitoring minute-by-minute on my
phone, are occupying almost all of my intellectual capacity. Hence my lassitude here and also in my own creative output,
although the trip to Heron Bay this weekend was a notable exception.

I go through these flat spots periodically, and the best I think I can usually do is to be patient with myself, remember
that it won't last forever, and ride it out. I'm also grateful to Hilary during these times, whose unwavering support
for me regardless of if I'm struggling or on top of the world, is a constant source of strength for me.

Played a bit more Borderlands 3 but already it's feeling like a time sink, which is funny because I can play Diablo 3
for hours and hours and it certainly dosn't feel like that at all. I've got a full set of Pestilence Armor right now and
am getting used to gameplay where Corpse Lance is my only source of damage, which is a bit of a challenge when Land of
the Dead is on cooldown and I'm playing at a Torment level where even some of the common monsters can one-shot me.

Which is a bunch of nerd talk for discovering that elite Diablo 3 gameplay is challenging and exciting, and will
certainly do as a fun distraction until I find my moorings again.
