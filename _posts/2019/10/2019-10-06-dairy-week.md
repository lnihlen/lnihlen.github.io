I spent the day plastered to the couch playing Borderlands 3. I found several good grooves of gameplay, including a blue
Jakobs shotgun that took me from levels 16 to 20. When the game works, it's classic Borderlands fun, moving from
strength to strength. I can play it for hours because there really aren't any lulls in the action or boring spots where
it might occur to me to take a break.

Then I hit a glitch on a boss battle with Katagawa Jr., which had been a bit of a tedious grind, only to have him vanish
with less than 10% health to go. Reading online, it looks like he switches modes to a short-range melee focus, but for
me he just vanished, never to reappear. I wandered around, looted every box that I hadn't had time to even open. Then
that was the end of my Borderlands 3 gameplay for the weekend.

Hilary and I are still watching this new season of Bake Off, and tonight was Dairy Week. I love how everyone helps each
other on the show, even as the challenges become less about baking and more about putting folks through the ringer.
