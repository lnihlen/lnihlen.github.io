Having missed the last bi-weekly {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal, it was great to get back together
with the folks and make some laptop jams. We worked on a few exercises to build our chops on sound design, then
developed sounds for the Nature piece. The network clock revision that I worked on didn't work, so that's some debugging
for the weekend queued up. But we managed to struggle through even with the broken tech. I think I need a better way to
test the clocks then just my laptop and another computer. Time to get the Raspberry Pis fired up again for a test grid.

But all that for another day.
