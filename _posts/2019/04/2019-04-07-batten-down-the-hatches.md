That feeling of need to prepare for a busy return to work this week intensified
today, motivating me to try and button up as much as possible today. It's not
like this was a day without fun, however. The rain has let up, so I took the
opportunity to take the dogs to the beach.

I'm trying to give them extra care while Hilary is out of town, they are down to
half their regular number of caretakers. It looks like rain next weekend, but
I'm hoping the rains will let up soon and we can resume our semi-rigorous
tradition of beach visits every weekend.

There is an informal {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal tomorrow
and I had been hoping to attend, so I spent some time today organizing the
various Quarks I've written for SCLOrk into a single, new Quark called
[SCLOrkTools](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkTools). Unlike the last attempt
at consolidation this time I tried to replay the history from the old
repositories into the new one. There were many merge conflicts, thanks to files
moving between repositories on several occasions earlier, but in the end I think
we've arrived with everything up to date and intact in their new (and hopefully
final) home.

I also thought this might serve as good practice for the same sort of trick on
{% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}, given my recent decision to
pull the C++ code back in to the
[Scintillator Quark](https://github.com/lnihlen/Scintillator). I'm anticipating
far fewer conflicts when importing the history there, because the files have
been in different directories, with different names, even different programming
languages. I'm wanting to finish up the current branch I'm working on, getting
to YAML generation on the SuperCollider side, before I try and pull in the
other repo. So maybe next weekend hopefully? We'll have to see.

Hoping to get to bed at a decent hour so it's time to wrap up.
