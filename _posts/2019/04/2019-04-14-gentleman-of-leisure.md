So I'm not sure what happened to the body of this blog post. I wrote it on my Linux workstation, which I relocated to
my office. There's some memory of talking about playing more Diablo 3, moving some of the computer parts (including
this workstation) back into my office, cleaning the house to prepare for Hilary's return, doing emotional work on the
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} code formatting discussions, and a brief segue into a discussion around
trying to make Linux font rendering not look so rough at high density.

Because that was pretty much the day, and the blog entry as best I can remember it. There's not even a ```vim``` swap
file around to try and restore it, it's just gone. I guess after doing 200+ of these I can be excused for losing one.
But it's unfortunate. I'll try not to have that happen again.
