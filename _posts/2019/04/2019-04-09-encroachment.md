Productive day at work, then through some heavy traffic for Ethiopian take-out,
then home. With Hilary 3 hours away we've discovered that the time shift works
that a good time for a goodnight phone call for her is during my commute home.

At least, it worked yesterday and today. Certainly sitting in traffic is a lot
better when I'm talking to her than not. I miss her a ton, now, but it's under
a week until she comes back, and I really do think her time in Yoga teacher
training is well spent.

After some household duties I had a few hours to myself this evening, so spent
a short amount of time playing Cuphead, then dug in to some of the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code that has been waiting for a bit
while I got distracted by work on {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}.
I was able to make some progress on the Wiimote wrapper code I've been working
on. The big blocker had been trying to decide what to do with the accelerometer
polling data, but now that I've decided to provide those data as control bus
values things nicely clarified.

The animals are lonelier than usual, I observe, which means sitting on the couch
usually results in multiple paws, noses, and other appendages butting up against
my laptop, under my elbows, and pushing in to my body in other forms, attempting
to slowly push my laptop away and replace it with some animal that hopes I will
lavish the same attentions I give to this machine on them.

There's been an ongoing discussion around SuperCollider code formatting, and I
spent a bit more time tinkering with some of the discussion points and designing
a survey to hopefully drive consensus around some of these questions. I wish I
had been a bit more active of a developer on SuperCollider code itself, recently,
because I feel like I'm super well past the kind of credibility that might
have earned otherwise with this community, but nobody else has really stepped up
and this has been a somewhat divisive discussion that everyone wants to see
driven to conclusion.

So it's hard to tell if I'm doing some dirty work that nobody is engaging with
because it's exactly that, *dirty work*, or am I off just talking in a corner
and the real discussion has just shot right past me. Being confident that it's
the former situation requires just that, *confidence*, which having submitted
something like a grand total of 3 PRs to this project I am definitely not
feeling much of that.

Well, best intentions and all that. They seem to be the pavestones on this road
I'm on right now.. might as well follow it! What could possibly go wrong?!
