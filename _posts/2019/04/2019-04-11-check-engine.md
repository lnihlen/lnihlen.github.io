I was not able to fall asleep last night. I think in part it is Hilary being
out of town, it can tend to throw my sleep cycles out of balance. However, after
losing some sleep earlier in the week I have been trying to be more aware of
going to bed at a decent hour, despite not having the person I've slept next
to for years now there to fall asleep with.

Last night, actually, even though perhaps Hilary not being around has disrupted
my sleep, I was glad she wasn't around because I was in bed by 10 pm but just
tossed and turned all night long. So it was good to not have to worry about
disturbing her with my own suffering.

The thing that's keeping me up is that this last round of perf was kind of a
wakeup call. I'm not sure I have so many more of those in me. When I start
thinking about those 20 more years of work, and the endgame sort of scenarios
I was talking about yesterday, I don't have any good way to reconcile those
two sort of observations.

I guess I wonder - would there be more middle ground at a company outside of
Silicon Valley? The last time I had poked around exploring how much not having
to commute over the hill would cost me the price was way too high. Now, I'm not
so sure. What's the price of nights like that? What's the price of two out of
very ten months in a year being like that? That might be the price that, very
soon, I can't pay.
