The middle path continues to elude me. I'm either all in or I'm all out. This is
great for a lot of things that require a high level of commitment, but moderation
somehow feels like a higher state of energy for me than full burn all the time
on something. One way I can moderate is to *modulate*, like
[Pulse Width Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation),
which is a binary/black-and-white way to approximate an analog/gray-area signal.

The last month or so of work fits this pattern - thinking about the weeks leading
up to the vacation last week, weeks of intense days in the office followed by
feeling a real urge to make progress on so many personal projects at home,
followed by a week on the couch playing Xbox.

Even more consequential, if and when I decide that I'd like to find a
path at work that might allow for some more space for the rest of my life, with
the trade off that I will have decided to stop trying to climb the corporate
ladder.

Since I've joined Google the goal has always been advancement. I was an unknown
quantity when I joined the company and I think to me getting promoted at work
has been a way of telling myself and the world that I could make the cut, I could
work with some of the best and brightest in the industry, even the world, and
hold my own.

At work I have met a few folks at my level, but quite a few more at the next,
that have decided to no longer pursue advancement, but continue to do solid
work at their current level, and perhaps turn some of that additional time and
energy into other pursuits (typically family). The first time I had a real
discussion with someone with this calculus my mind was completely blown.

First of all I was struck by the incredible sense of privilege that this
represents. How could anyone work so hard and be so lucky as to be at Google
and intentionally *choose* not to try and maximize the opportunity?

I guess I always thought that the end game for me at Google was one of three
outcomes. One would be that I would reach the limit of my ability, meaning that
the job would get so hard that I wouldn't be able to advance any more. Hopefully
Google's advancement philosophy would work to protect me from being promoted in
to a job that I actually can't do (and so eventually wash out), but I see many
people around me at more senior levels than I am that are in this situation,
working hard to keep up with the demands of their current job, and with
advancement not really top of mind. Sometimes I worry that I'm actually already
in this situation, which is a depressing thought when I think that I have
probably another 20 years of work in front of me before retirement.

The second outcome I had envisioned as likely was that I would "retire undefeated,"
or perhaps not undefeated but rather "unbroken," meaning that the clock ran out
on my career and bank account ran up enough that I can afford to stop working,
never having taken my sights off of advancement. In my (perhaps naive) view when
I joined Google this seemed like the only obvious outcome I could foresee. Why
upend my entire life, move from New Mexico to a state where I knew almost no one,
and join one of the most infamous rat races in the US (if not the world), if
I wasn't going to try and climb as high as possible? Why do anything at all if
you aren't trying to be the absolute best you can be?

The (frequently unspoken) third outcome is total burnout, where the choice
is forced to be between serious physical and/or mental health consequences or
leaving work.

So perhaps there's real upside in learning this modulation trick. And what I
first thought was privilege might also be wisdom, they *are* trying to maximize
the opportunity, perhaps just not with rank. And 20 more years is a long time,
who knows what the future will bring?
