Got up early-ish for final organization and then driving Hilary over the hill for departure
on the first leg of her journey to Pennsylvania for Yoga training. Since I was stag I went
to Fry's and picked up an Xbox One. I had steered clear of the console at launch but had
always had it back of mind that there were a few platform exclusives (and a few not but
enhanced for the Xbox One X) that might be worth some time.

After buying the console, the trip to Whole Foods felt like preparing for a winter storm.
My supply strategy there was with the assumption that I might not want to leave the house
for a few days.

Then it was home to begin the setup and lengthy patch cycle, selection of games, and queueing
up half a terabyte of content to download. Cuphead came down first, and is a real treat. I
had seen it coming for Switch, and it might actually be a better fit for the switch, given
that you can kind of dive in and play a short level, die a few times (or a lot), and then
duck out for whatever else is going on.

The next thing down was Valkyria Chronicles 4. I had played this briefly on the Switch but
I think it felt like a little too much game for the Switch. Load times are overlong there,
and with multiple not-really-skippable cutscenes and awful voice acting I found my patience
for the game rapidly dwindling. Then I hit a bugged mission and that was it.

The more powerful X loads those annoying scenes in a jiff, and the whole game seems a lot
less clunky as a result. I played past where the game had lost me on the Switch and then
some.

Couple more games downloading, and I'm planning on spending some good lazy time tomorrow
with them, along with cooking up a few dishes to last me for the next few days. Vacation
Staycation!
