I had read that the Switch version of Diablo 3 was great for the platform,
so this morning after breakfast I signed in and started a Wizard build.
It's been a few years since I've payed attention to D3 and I gotta say
the grip was strong. Outside of some routine household tasks like dog care
and stocking some groceries, I spent the day playing D3 on the Switch.

Now it's time for bed and I'm wondering if I might want to put Windows back
on the workstation, just to fire D3 up on a proper gaming computer. The
concept of Seasons is an interesting one, encouraging folks to start new
builds without all the built-up resources you get from your pre-existing
characters. Plus, I've been wanting to take a crack at getting a build
of {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %} on Windows going, as
that will one of the platforms I want to work on, and it feels a bit
closer to hand than does Mac thanks to Vulkan support on MacOS being so
lacking.

It's a huge waste of time but today was pretty fun. I also spent a minute
playing Celeste, which is just lovely. I particularly appreciated
the way that game manages my anxiety. I was getting stressed about passing
up a few strawberries, and got a postcard in the game saying that I should
remember to not stress about skipping the bonus things, they only count for
like a pride score, and to just relax and have fun with the game. That
message came at exactly the right time for me. Then the next one was a
reminder to think positive about the death count, which for me in a level is
in the triple digits typically. It's an indicator of me learning the game,
the friendly postcard says, and I shouldn't worry if it's high. Well ok!

I'm embarrased sometimes by how much getting permission can help. Getting
permission from a game to enjoy it actually really helps me. Perhaps I
should be more strong-minded but I'm just not.

I was Googling around about builds for the Wizard and found my way down
the Internet rabbit hole about elite-level D3 playing. I saw some incredible
Bone Lance Necromancer builds that just look really neat and fun to play.
Probably take a lot more time to get to that than I'm even capable of
investing in a game, but a man can dream, can't he?

Playing D3, particularly with the fixed camera angle floating above the
character, I am often reminded of looking at an amoeba under a microscope.
Your toon sort of scoots around, killing everything around it and absorbing
resources, getting stronger until it encounteres a bigger amoeba that kills
it instead. I know everyone talks about the Skinner Box fascination of these
games but to me I think it's a reminder of basic behavior we learned as
single-celled organisms.

There was some light discussion around the {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}
code formatting topic I've been spending some time on. I'm hoping to wrap that up
pretty soon, and then SC will have a C++ coding style guide, which I will turn
around a promptly apply to {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %} as well.

It's also getting to be time for the trips overseas I've got coming up in early
May. I'm starting to get pretty excited about that as well, and a bit
trepedations about it as well.
