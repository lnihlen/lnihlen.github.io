Woke up this morning with various UPS systems complaining and the lights off. Turns out the power had been out since
about 2:30 AM, and the battery backup that keeps the internet connection up was on its last legs. "Well great," I
thought, since I've been meaning to burn down some of the fuel in the generator, as there are all sorts of dire warnings
about running stale fuel in the things. I have some engineered fuel that's supposed to be good for like 5 years in
storage, but what was sitting in the genny was play old Chevron from like, October or so.

So I was actually pleasantly surprised to see that the generator still happily fired up and started burning that old
stale fuel with nary a complaint. Then there was some running around the house with extension cords and power strips
to get internet connectivity back. Given that where we live up in the mountains it's a bit more important than just
convenience to keep the 'net up, since without the cell phone range extender that's plugged into the router we have
just one tenuous bar of cell phone signal here.

I *did* notice recently that Google Fi is claiming either 3G or LTE coverage of this area, so the one Android phone I'm
keeping in kick I'll probably switch over to Fi, just to see if the connectivity gets any better. There's also the
dream of getting [The Football](http://www.groundcontrol.com/MCD-4800_BGAN_Terminal.htm), but given that those go for
about $13K it somehow continually slips out of my budget. Actually, browsing through the Ground Control site, there
are some more reasonably-priced options available here, like the
[510 BGAN Explorer](http://www.groundcontrol.com/BGAN_Explorer_510.htm). There's a range of powering options which means
that at home I could keep it plugged in to a UPS, then switch over to generator power in the event of another power
outage.

We also think it's important to stay in touch at our house because of all the problems California has been having with
wildfires in the wilderness. Every fire season I feel like we dodge a bullet, and I want to keep our phones functioning
so that if an alert comes that we need to bug out, we get it. So it's not just luxury here, practicing keeping the net
up during a power outage for me is in some way part of disaster preparedness.

I didn't want to leave the generator running while we were gone so I packed it in after charging the UPS systems for a
bit, fully aware that they aren't really battery backup and relying on them to power equipment for longer than it takes
to get the generator going is somewhat unrealistic. In any event, I drove down to the end of my driveway, only to see
this:

Welp, there's your problem right there. I guess someone driving down our windy mountain road in the wee hours lost
control of their vehicle and hit the power pole, which caused it to topple. I hope nobody was hurt. I also knew that
it was going to take a lot longer than the roughly 2 hour estimate PG&E had sent Hilary as the repair time.

I had an afternoon meeting get canceled so I jammed home to let the dogs out and see if the power had been restored,
which it had not. In fact, I had to negotiate with PG&E workers to let me drive down my driveway. It was a good chance
to debug some of the power systems and make sure the right stuff (and only the right stuff) was plugged in to the UPS.

After getting the local network up I was disappointed to discover that it looked like either the data cables on that
pole were also not disabled for repairs (likely), or the battery backups on the local cable network had perhaps given
out themselves. In any event, a local area network isn't nearly as much fun as one that is connected to the mighty
Internet. Hence, the thinking about the BGAN connection, but transfer costs on those data are so high that it would
really have to be only for actual disaster situations, just keeping a tiny, expensive pipe open to the Internet so we
can stay informed about any developments while the poop hits the fan.

The disaster mindset also had me thinking about running backups on the various computer systems I'm maintaining at home,
so I'm now reading through what
[Gentoo themselves are thinking about](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Infrastructure/Backups_v3). So there's that
to think about. Forewarned is forearmed and all that.

What with all the healthy paranoia and the like it didn't leave a lot of time for other creative output.
[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) and all that, although I
hear that theory has been roundly debunked in professional mental health circles. Tomorrow, tomorrow.
