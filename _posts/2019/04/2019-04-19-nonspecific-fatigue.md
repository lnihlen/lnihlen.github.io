Besides getting up early I can't reliably determine why I'm so exhausted this evening. It was a reasonably chill day
at work, with even some good news on a few long-term projects.  The meetings that it was important for me to be in
person were canceled, so I took the opportunity to bounce home a bit early, beat the rush, and grab some groceries in
the hopes that I won't have to leave the house until Monday.

Took a few meetings from home, then I was done for the week. It was a beautiful sunny day, and like most Fridays in
the Bay Area traffic wasn't nearly as bad as it is during the rest of the week. Regardless of the perf results I'm
waiting for, things are going well at work. Yes, the whole fight around coding styles on
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} has been draining, but nothing I haven't handled before, and much less
bad than the worst of some such.

It's got to be waiting for those promo results. I glance at my phone all day long, checking each email that comes in
to see if it's going to have some clue in it. It's not healthy, but even just thinking about how unhealthy it is drains
me as well.

I did write a few more tests on {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}. Progress is so slow on that right now
it feels like every line is a fight. Perhaps things will speed up once the first kind of slice is in. I do feel like
every time I tackle a small piece of the overall problem I learn a little bit more. So that's encouraging.

I'm just so damned tired right now.
