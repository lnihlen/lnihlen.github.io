I stayed up way too late last night playing video games, so when my dog Molly
woke me up at (a very reasonable for her time) 9 I wasn't feeling well rested.
The reality of returning to work wasn't *heavy* on my mind but I am feeling
aware of my available free time rapidly returning to very small amounts. So with
that, I spent significant time ticking off some of those outstanding chores I
had been hoping to tackle.

I left the house for the first time in a few days, and was immediately aware
of how everyone around me was definitely *not* Hilary. Then it was home for
some maintenance work, as well as responding to a lengthy email about code
style among a few {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} developers.

And that was pretty much 12 hours. Unfortunately I made almost no progress on
{% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %} today but I'm going to try to get
to bed much earlier tonight so that I can get good rest and have a full day
tomorrow.
