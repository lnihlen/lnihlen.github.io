There's some interesting potential changes in my professional life happening, but all under a cloak of secrecy, so I
can't talk about it here. Instead I'll talk about how I'm obsessively playing Diablo 3 every evening. I'm grinding Rifts
with my Necromancer in order to try and get more pieces of the different armor sets that are described as the elite
builds on [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/).

I'm at a point in the gameplay where really very little is happening. I run three Nephalim Rifts for every Greater Rift,
which usually takes me under an hour to do. I've been running this set of rifts at least once a day for a while now, and
maybe once every 10 days or so some item will finally drop that might actually be what I'm looking for. But at this
point, with other things being so uncertain, it's nice to have something predictable, even if there's no actual
progression going on.
