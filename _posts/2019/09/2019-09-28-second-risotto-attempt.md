I've been cutting my own hair for a long time now. I remember doing it as early as high school. I remember going to
Supercuts in middle school and hating it. I don't think a lot of folks know how to cut curly hair, so I would end up
just getting the same all-over-length buzz cut with clippers every time. I think one time in high school I was hanging
out with a friend and we cut each other's hair, and that was probably the last time I paid for a haircut, that I can
remember. This was maybe 25 years ago.

Hilary has been visiting a nice salon in Santa Cruz for a little while now, and I've been impressed with the service
she's been receiving. Her hair looks great, but what is particularly nice is the story of them working with her to find
an ideal look. So today was the first time in 25 years that I paid someone for a haircut. It was awesome, and now I have
like a grownup haircut.

A relatively mundane day, but I also took another attempt at making risotto, this time with the hard-won knowledge that
I shouldn't trade white wine for white wine vinegar, at least not 1-for-1. It turned out a lot better than last time,
and I think I made some improvements to the texture as well. That is a demanding dish, but so tasty when it works out.

I'm hoping tomorrow to get out and do some field recording, but we'll have to see what the weather brings. I might be
able to at least scout a location, walk around a bit and take some notes. Could be a reason to get out of the house and
tramp around a bit outdoors, at least, so that's something.
