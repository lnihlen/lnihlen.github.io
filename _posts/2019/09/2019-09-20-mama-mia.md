After work Hilary and I headed over to Ben Lomond for the opening night of Mama Mia at the Mountain Community Theater.
Hilary's voice coach Sydney is starring in the role of Sophie. It was opening night, so it was great to see the cast put
it together and take the show out for a spin for the first time.

I'm new to the "jukebox musical," this idea that you would take existing songs and stitch a plot around them to make a
new artifact. And I'm not the biggest ABBA fan, but I am partial to songs that lay down a cheesy synth jam and then a
drum groove on top. It has me stoked to try out a few more projects coordinating drums and my own synth lines.

It's not my normal taste in music but I like going to shows with Hilary and I almost inevitably find something to enjoy.
We've got a few different shows lined up in the near future, so should be fun.
