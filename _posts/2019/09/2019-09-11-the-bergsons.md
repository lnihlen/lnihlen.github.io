This one came out of nowhere, but [Children of Morta](http://childrenofmorta.com/) just came out, and while I've only
had a few hours with it I'm quite enamored. It's a fun roguelike with snappy combat, pixel graphics, and tasty drips of
narrative in between missions.

Of course a rad video game comes out in the heat of perf at work, alongside the resumption of
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. Fortunately because I've layered a few managers under me right now their perf
load is a lot heavier than mine, as every direct report must be accounted for, but that doesn't absolve me from my
responsibilites for peer reviews for colleagues going up for promotion.

Google relies heavily on peer reviews for promo considerations, particularly at the higher ranks, so the pressure is on
when writing these things. Combined with my recent cynicism about the process, I'm finding this effort demoralizing. But
I will carry on, particularly because the ratings are due in final form by Friday.

After that, I think there's a couple of long meetings to discuss all these data, and we can call this perf season a
wrap. So one week of paperwork crunch is a lot better than last time. Of course, this iight load is largely due to the
fact that I am not trying for my own promotion this time, so perhaps it's a bit of a bitter thing too, that I'm
comparatively unloaded.

On the plus side, that leaves more time for the Bergsons and their lovely video game.
