This being the second day of our traditional Hilary birthday Disneyland trip we followed tradition and slept in,
wandered around California Adventure, then rented a poolside cabana for the afternoon. I'm engrossed in two very
different novels right now, one is [Silver, Sword, and Stone](http://mariearana.net/silver-sword-and-stone/) that I
picked up after reading a favorable review in the New York Times. It's a history of Latin America but organized around
these three themes, and doesn't read like your typical history book, thanks in large part to the author's obvious
encyclopedic knowledge of the topic but also her elegant, flowing prose.

The other is another Barbara Holloway novel by the inimitable Kate Wilhelm. THey make an odd mix but both are great, so
it was nice to sit poolside (after a dip, of course), eat fresh fruit, drink water, and read, particularly after a day
and a half of standing in the heat.

We took in our final "baby rave" as we like to call them, the World of Color. Tomorrow we head home, and Monday it's
right back in to work, with perf season in full bloom now, and a first {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
rehearsal Monday evening to boot. So I'm extra grateful for the resting time in the shade.
