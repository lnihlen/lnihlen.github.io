So in California, and in most other places in the United States, the leftmost lane is considered the passing lane.
Hanging out in that lane for miles of open road is not only considered rude, it's against the law, at least as written.
But most everyone seems to just hang out in the left hand lane. I've noticed while commuting on Highway 17, the twisty
road through the Santa Cruz mountains, that the roles of the lanes seem to have become inverted. So, there are tons of
people cruising down 17 in the left lane, leaving the right lane mostly open, which then makes the right lane the
passing lane. This has mystified me for some time. Why did people choose to cruise in the passing lane? I'm not immune
from this behavior, by the way. I've caught myself hanging out there too.

This morning, I had a revelation. I think it's the commuter lanes. See, a lot of highways reserve the leftmost lane for
high-occupancy vehicles during rush hour. For instance, on Highway 85, which is the other big part of my commute, the
leftmost lane is reserved for drivers with at least one passenger (or motorcycles) between 5am and 9am, and again
between 3pm and 7pm. What happens is that, until every lane becomes gridlocked, the commuter lanes do move faster, and
so getting over to the leftmost lane and staying there until you need to exit is actually a sane and perfectly legal
thing to do.

But what is happening with commuter lanes is that it is training drivers to think about the leftmost lane as the "I'm
going to stay on the highway for a while" lane, as opposed to the passing lane. This is helpful for me. I'm past being
mad about the situation, I just want to know why. I'd like to think the various annoyances and inconveniences in my life
are there for a reason. Or at least it's nice to have a halfway reasonable theory.
