I remember telling my first manager at Google that I was most curious about the areas of friction within the team and
within the company, because those were the areas where we had the most to learn. From a certain perspective I think
people are defined in struggle. I remember when I studied martial arts that we would remind ourselves that at our
moments of greatest frustration were also the moments of greatest learning.

I should hope that this is indeed a time of great learning. I told a person I've been coaching for a while at work today
that is a responsibility of adulthood to transform cynicism into wisdom. With the best of intentions I am hoping that I
can, with some time, do just that for these days.
