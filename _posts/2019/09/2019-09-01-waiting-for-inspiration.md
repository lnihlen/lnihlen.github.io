A bit more work on the {% include tag_link.html tag="chickens" %} today, moving the interior food and water containers
to the human door, from a wall under the roosting bars. I don't know why I put them there in the first place, access to
the containers was poor and the chickens would poop on the containers while they were roosting.

We reheated some of the ultra vinegar risotto for lunch, and I made pizza for dinner. The carrot cake I made was also
great with a morning cup of coffee. I leveled a seasonal Diablo 3 character from the mid 30s to 62.

It's nice knowing I have tomorrow off. I'm also starting to become aware of the fact that there are a rapidly
diminishing number of free days between now and the first {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal, which
would be the most productive time to introduce radical changes to the software, like the asset system.

The project is in the kind of grungy finish work stage at the moment, and I'm not feeling that motivated to grind it
out. Perhaps tomorrow.
