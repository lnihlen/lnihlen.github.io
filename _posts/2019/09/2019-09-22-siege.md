Given that almost everything in my professional life, and several things in my personal life, are in flux right now,
this weekend had me feeling like a bit in a state of siege. While I'm home I'm not at peace, rather I'm sort of moving
from worry to worry, checking email and messages, and trying to get some weekend chores done in between. So it was
neither really restful nor productive, but it wasn't not either. There was maybe enough of both, and it'll have to do
for the weekend.

I switched gears on {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, writing a quick draft of a tool to pick sections of an
audio sample. I also designed a few sounds for the Nature piece. I wasn't too excited about that piece to begin with but
now that I'm starting to design some of the sounds for it I'm starting to have some fun with it. One of the cool things
about SCLOrk is that it occasionally requires me to make audio with SuperCollider, always a worthwhile activity.

Feeling like I could use another 48 hours of weekend, but that's not to be.
