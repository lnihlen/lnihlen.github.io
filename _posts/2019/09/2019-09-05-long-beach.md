Tomorrow is Hilary's birthday, so after the day's work was done she and I met at San Jose airport and grabbed a quick
flight to Long Beach Airport. I hadn't flown in to this airport before, and was surprised by how small it was, and
walking out on the tarmac from the plane. After a brief passage through the gate indoors it was back outside to pick up
our luggage. I thought perhaps I had missed a turn or something for a second. It reminded me of some of the airports
when traveling in Ecuador, or perhaps like an airport on a tropical island. I wonder what they do for baggage claim when
it's raining? This of course makes me think of the problems right now with Dorian, and I'm hoping our Bahamanian
neighbors are doing ok.

We had a late dinner at Downtown Disney, followed by some light shopping and then it was time for bed. Tomorrow is
Disneyland, and I think we're planning on spending some serious time exploring the new Star Wars area, Galaxy's Edge.
This is going to be a bit different than my previous trips to Disneyland, where I could maintain some emotional distance
between the park and myself. My experience of Star Wars is much more personal than of the Little Mermaid, for instance.

So I'm excited but perhaps also a little wary of how that might change things. We shall see soon.
