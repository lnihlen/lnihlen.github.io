Today is Hilary's birthday, and we are engaged in our traditional birthday trip to Disneyland. It's our first time here
with Galaxy's Edge open, so we headed there forthwith. I have to say I am impressed by what they've built. It has a
sense of place in the Star Wars universe, with excellent set and sound design making it feel as though you are in a
living world.

Then, you round a corner, and sitting right there, plain as day, is the Millennium Falcon.

Hilary had some friends also in the park today by coincidence, so we met up with them once or twice, and they were
lovely. We had a long day, riding several rides, assembling our own light sabers, and watching two different light shows
at night, before returning to our hotel and collapsing in bed.

I got email notification that the scans of the negatives from the first two rolls of film shot on the medium-format
Pentax 645 camera I have been playing around with were available for download from the film processing service. But I'm
too tired to edit or post any samples tonight. I'm pleased to see the results, although it's also clear some more
practice refamiliarizing myself with a manual camera would probably be beneficial.

Perhaps tomorrow.
