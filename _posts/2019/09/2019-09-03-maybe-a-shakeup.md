So I had a tough conversation with a report at work today in which he was upset about how things are unfolding on a
project. And while I agreed with all of his points I was trying to advise a level of professional detachment about the
state of the project that might make his life a bit easier. But that really fell on deaf ears, which is fine, because I
think that what he was hearing was that I was advising him to care a little bit less, which is terrible advice that very
few people ever take (thank goodness!).

Being in middle management I can see it a bit from both sides, in that I can see how a decision that may look completely
misguided from the individual feature or product level likely makes sense at a higher organizational level. Of course I
can't name specifics or talk about this concretely, but part of life at a big company is that sometimes larger actions
that may or may not make sense on a macro scale just seem like completely counter-intuitive nonsense on the lower
levels. You have to either take it on faith that it makes sense on some higher level, or develop some detachment about
the ebb and flow of individual projects.

Or maybe that's horrible advice. I really don't know any more. Because of this same organizational complexity at Google
I feel like I have been sidelined on my career for years with a job that demands significantly less of me than what I'm
capable of. And the best well-intentioned advice I've received from the experts at my disposal is that I should wait,
for years possibly, for an opportunity to open at higher organizational levels within the company. But remember again
that it is an article of faith, or detachment, that those same higher organizational levels within the company are going
to make decisions that make sense, within a reasonable length of time.
