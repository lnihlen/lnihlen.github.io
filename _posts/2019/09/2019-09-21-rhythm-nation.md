In the second day of our concert blowout Hilary and I headed up to the Chase Center in San Francisco, the home court of
the Golden State Warriors, in order to see Janet Jackson perform her Rhythm Nation anniversary tour. I'll admit that
while the tour was well executed it didn't grab me nearly as much as the Beyonce concerts I've seen. Granted, these are
very different artists, it's just the only kind of comparable experience I've had. I don't know her repertoire nearly as
well, and the sound was so overpoweringly out of balance that even the few songs I am familiar with were almost
unrecognizable. Ms. Jackson is a remarkable dancer, however, and I enjoyed the visual effects.  I found myself wondering
how I might be able to reproduce them with {% include tag_link.html tag="scintillator" %}, should I ever resume work on
that project.

Aside from that, I spent a minute on some of the sound design homework for the new
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} piece, and played some Diablo 3. It will be nice to have a day mostly at home,
hopefully to rest and relax a bit before plunging back into the work week. But now it's late, after returning home from
the long drive from San Francisco, and the weekend is already more than halfway done.
