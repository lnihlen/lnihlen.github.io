This isn't the right forum for discussion about the many goings on at or around work, and Hilary and I caught a late
supper at Cafe Cruz so my play time was very limited, but I remain consistently impressed with this Children of Morta
video game. It strikes me as a masterful use of game design and must have been very thoroughly playtested, because of
how balanced everything feels. The difficulty is demanding but seldom feels unfair or punishing, with further play and
advancing mastery rewarded with ever new twists, abilities, unlocks, and more challenge that compels you to incorporate
these new systems into your play in order to survive.

Runes, introduced just a few sessions ago, are now essential to survive. The secondary and tertiary skills of each
character demand individual strategies and must be employed effectively in order to progress. The game establishes a
comfortable cadence of content introduction and then breaks it, changing directions and evolving in new and interesting
directions.. And the small emotional moments, characterizing different aspects of Bergson family life, are satisfying
yet mostly understated. This is a masterfully made video game, I enthusiastically recommend it and am enjoying it
thoroughly.
