Yet another day devoid of intellectual effort. After our morning workout, and cooking breakfast, I finished leveling a
seasonal Necromancer in Diablo 3 up to 70. Then I played puzzle games on my laptop while Hilary and I variously watched
movies and TV. Hilary hadn't seen Predator before, so we watched it. It's fallen far from where it was in my mind as a
middle school student, but perhaps is clinging to the "so bad it's good" territory. At least Hilary got to see the
birthplace of the "get to the choppa" meme.

Tomorrow I return to work, and so will need to turn the old brain back on. Maybe then I'll have something more
substantive to say here, as well.
