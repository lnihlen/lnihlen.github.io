Grawer and Arya came over after work tonight and we had another jam. They have been playing together under the name
Desolation Wildebeest. I'm not sure if we'll get a gig together with that moniker but it's been good to play some drums
with other folks too. Grawer is playing bass this time, with me on drums and Arya on horns going through effects. I'm
hopeful we can get on a regular practice cadence, maybe put together a set.

Or if not, at least a few more jams would be great.
