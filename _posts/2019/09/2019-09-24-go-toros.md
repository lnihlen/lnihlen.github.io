Hilary hadn't yet taken in the glory that is "Bring it On" so we picked it up on Play and watched it this evening. It's
a problematic movie, to say the least, but worth an evening's entertainment. "Are these white people going to kiss?" and
"are these white people going to overcome their adversity?"

It's looking like I'll have to head to Phoenix in October to support my mom during back surgery, so a little light
entertainment like this was helpful. And I think we're finally mostly done with perf, so I got that going for me too,
which is great.

I had no idea there were 6 "Bring it On" movies in the series. Crikey.
