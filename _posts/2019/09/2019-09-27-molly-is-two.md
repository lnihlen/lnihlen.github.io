![Molly the Dog]({{ "assets/img/blog/2019-09-27-1.png" | absolute_url }})

Yesterday was Molly's second birthday, at least according to our vet records that we got transfered from her original
owner. Last May I went to get a tattoo on my lower left leg, and there at the tattoo parlor in Santa Cruz was Molly. One
of the tattoo artists was trying to find her a home, having just fallen through on a first attempt to re-home her with a
friend. I guess the friend's landlord vetoed Molly's stay there with under an hour.

I fell in love with her immediately. Hilary dropped by while I was getting tattooed to meet her. And, after some
additional discussion with the tattoo artist to establish credibility with her, we brought her home when my tattoo was
finished.

And that was that. I love my dog so much.
