I spotted it in others first - that point when you go past where your emotions can quickly bend back into a regular
shape. A former manager called that "tilt mode," like in a pinball machine that has detected undue external forces and
cancels all further input from the user until the ball is fouled out.

Some wicked insomnia last night, mostly due to thinking about all this career stuff, leaving me with only about 2 hours
of sleep all told. So maybe there wasn't even enough energy in the system for me to hit tilt mode. Or, maybe this whole
process I'm going through right now is the reset out of tilt mode.

Or maybe I'm not a pinball machine. But when I close my eyes, I could swear I see some seven segment displays lighting
up back there somewhere, spelling out TILT.
