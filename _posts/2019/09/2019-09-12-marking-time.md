So I'm starting to feel like if my whole strategy for work right now is to pass the time, in order to help with my
patience, this whole blogging every day thing is making it a bit tough. That's because right now I sit down each evening
and try to think of something inque to discuss for this blog, and outside of the work stuff that I obviously can't talk
about most days right now it feels like I really don't have much of note to discuss. That's kind of depressing to think
about in itself, but these are the consequences of the choices I've made.

It's probably better to be mindful of each passing day, even if there was nothing to distinguish the day from any of the
others. It was a unique event that will never happen again.
