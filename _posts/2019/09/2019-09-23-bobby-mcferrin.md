There was a scheduling conflict with {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal this evening. Hilary and I had
tickets to see Bobby McFerrin at the Rio in Santa Cruz. It was a tough conflict because the SCLOrk rehearsals are really
fun, but Bobby had to take priority. I had seen him perform once in Albuquerque many years ago and it is a singular
experience.

We had an early dinner and then headed over to the show. He followed a similar format to what I remembered, including
some largely improvised pieces, accompanying a local dancer, and handing a mic around for duets. They performed for
around 90 minutes but it went by in the space of a few breaths, from where I was sitting.

He's got access to the pure music. As Hilary put it, "he has the light."
