I feel so exhausted these days that I keep waiting for day where it might be possible for me to work from home, sleep in
some when I would normally be commuting,, and take meetings in my pajamas all day by just doing a VC from the neck up.
But every day I go in to work right now I'm glad I did. As a manager there's a lot of work that happens in meetings, and
it's helpful to be able to "read the room," understand how what's being said is landing, hear all the little nuances and
perhaps some of the side conversations. Presence matters, even a distracted, tired presence. But gosh this has been a
week.

My mom is going to require back surgery, and it's a two-day procedure, followed by many months of recovery. I'm flying
out to Arizona to be with her while Hilary holds down the fort here in California. Since I don't want to be distracted
by work I'm taking vacation, but it also means that I won't have much else in the way of vacation to take for the rest
of the year. Not that I have grand plans or anything but I do feel like I could use a rest.
