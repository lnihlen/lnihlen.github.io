Typical Saturday around here, which is a good thing. Cooked breakfast, played video games, did our weekly grocery store
run. As soon as I got home I got a start on on a Bolognese sauce, thinking that the longer the sauce cooks down the
better it will taste. This was more of a "cook up some italian sausage and some veggies, then drop a jar of sauce in"
kind of Bolognese. Hilary had some fresh tomatos from our garden so I chopped them up and threw them in. I started
thinking about braising techniques, like how I did the carne adovada last time I attempted it. I think next time I
attempt this recipe I'll start it from scratch with the tomato paste.

Made some good headway with Children of Morta, and that was really about it. All in all a very relaxing day, I think
I could have used like another 24 hours of the same but what there was, was quite nice.
