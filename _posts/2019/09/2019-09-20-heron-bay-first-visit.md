Way back in May I had taken that class in field recording from Chris Watson in Southern France. I didn't have adequate
gear, and had many struggles with level setting, and was still just kind of figuring stuff out. It still was a lot of
fun, and I started to germinate the idea of {% include tag_link.html tag="solitary_bees" %}. While France was
incredible, I had been trail running in the Santa Cruz Mountains and knew there were many places that would be
interesting to try and field record.

There was a long delay while I worked up the motivation, as well as saved up enough coin to step up my gear a bit. Chris
had generously let us listen to a bunch of different setups, both his own and also encouraged other students to share
recordings from their own gear. The Schoeps ORTF setups I heard recorded were really the tipping point for me, knowing
that I really just had to try and get one of those setups to do my own recordings. I managed to order one of the Schoeps
setups used, directly from the company, by working with an American distributor.  It was a bit of a matter of patience
but the rig arrived on Thursday, much to my excitement.

Another piece of the puzzle fell into place when I read
[this article](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/08/28/nature-gone-bay-area-beach-getting-washed-away/) in the East Bay
Times almost exactly a month ago. Here was a beach in the Bay, threatened by climate change, being eaten away by the
rising tide.

So today, microphone and medium-format camera in hand, I took the trip over the hill to Richmond and hiked up to the
beach in question. I think properly documenting these sites is going to take more than one visit, and I also think I
still have some kinks to work out with the metering and level setting on the recorder I'm using. But I shot two rolls of
black and white and one roll of color film, and had a lovely day tramping around the beach. The winds were high, as they
almost always are on the Bay, and there are three large airports within 50 miles of the spot, so it was a pretty
challenging recording environment. Right towards the end of the day I found a spot with some wind shelter and got a few
minutes of audio, but the waves were breaking over the low concrete wall the mic was behind and I started getting
worried about salt water landing on my beautiful new microphone.

I want to go back a few times more, at least to try my luck a few more times with the wind and the airplane traffic. I'm
thinking I could miss a little sleep (or maybe a lot) one morning, leave the house in the middle of the night, and catch
the dawn chorus up there, then roll over to work after. If I had located a sheltered spot that I could reliably return
to in the pre-dawn dark I might consider a return right away. I also need to get a hydrophone or two, because water is a
serious element of this area. So perhaps the plan is go back during the day with hydrophones, maybe try to find a good
sheltered spot, then one or two more trips for that.

Despite the recordings not turning out so well, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. And I'm hoping some more practice will
bring better quality recordings, too.
