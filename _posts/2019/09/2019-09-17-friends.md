Having a bit of a rough time at work these days, and I want to express gratitude towards my friends in this time.  I've
had a few close friends recently take time out of their work schedules, which are particularly busy for perf season, to
talk me through options and ideas about my current career path.

I'm sick of thinking through these things by myself, so it's so helpful to have another person to bounce some of these
ideas off. And listening to friends I respect, who have had careers of distinction, helps me to feel validated, in that
they share their own stories and struggles, and acknowledge my own feelings and concerns.

I don't normally think of myself as someone with a lot of friends, or someone who is broadly socially engaged. Most
evenings and weekends, I want to be home with my wife and my animals. But I have met some truly remarkable people at
Google, and in there sharing with me it helps me to remember that maybe things aren't as horrible as they seem, at leat
for a little while.
