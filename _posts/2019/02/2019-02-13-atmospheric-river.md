The rain is back upon us, snarling the commute home with another closure on
Highway 17, then another closure on the backup road Soquel San Jose. Once again
driving on other people's driveways in a long line of commuters to get home.
I made a promise to myself to do my best to remember this experience of driving
on congested mountain back roads the next time that the vagaries of traffic
turn my single-lane mountain road into a parking lot. Sooner or later, I guess
its just your turn. All parts of the commitment to mountain life. Still, though,
living here feels like a privilege, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

They call them [atmospheric rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river),
the most notable of which is the Pineapple Express, probably due to the movie.
Having grown up in Albuquerque I am perpetually amazed and grateful whenever it
rains, even if it has been raining for days. I also find it surprising and a bit
frightening just *how much* water can fall from the sky over the course of a
day here.

There's a creek that runs through part of our property and right now it's
roaring. We'll hear it for days after these rains stop. Thanks to climate change,
it seems that this amount of rainfall is the new normal around here. Pretty
much every roofer and contractor in Santa Cruz county is booked months out just
trying to repair the damage from downed trees, washed out roads, flooded
floors. I'm hoping, after the rains pass, to get in line with some of them to
do some additional preventative maintenance on the house. I don't think the
drainage on the property was built with this kind of rainfall happening every
winter.

Time will answer all, but I for one would like to do what I can from keeping
us all from washing away.
