Pardon me for a moment while I go full corporate weasel. Bureaucracy is one of
the most obvious signs of organizational dysfunction I encounter at work.
Fortunately at Google I find it somewhat rare, which might be surprising for
a company at such scale. I think bureaucracy happens when folks feel like they
aren't being heard, and feel a sense of responsibility over something that they
can't fully control.

Even more surprising to me is to encounter the occasional person who wields
bureaucracy as some kind of tool. It's the corporate equivalent of sending
something to "die in committee," meaning the goal is to so encumber an idea
with "due process" that it loses all vitality.

I attended a lengthy meeting today in which, at least on the surface, one of the
primary functions of my attendance was to be seen at that meeting, so as to
demonstrate the interest and investment in the relationship with this partner
team. So yes, I was a figurehead. Not my favorite part of the job but sometimes
necessary.

There's some bureaucracy to cut through here. I usually start by trying to get
a real understanding of what the wielder actually wants. Sometimes just being
heard, even if we can't provide whatever is desired, is a huge step forward.
How powerful it is to be heard and acknowledged.

All that said, I'll be glad to return to a more normal work schedule tomorrow.
There's certainly plenty at work that cries out for my attention at the moment.

And that's to say nothing of the projects outside of work. I was, at least,
able to make some small incremental progress on the
[SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock) design document. And
there's a 3-day weekend upcoming, so perhaps then I can sit down and implement
the clock, hopefully bringing my sense of obligation to
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} back from a sense of relative neglect.

There's also the chance to do some recording for
{% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} this weekend. And I'm hearing that
the odds of booking a gig for {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} go
up strongly when there's a recording I could provide that demonstrates some
of that I'm getting up to for that project.
