Still feeling pretty wiped out this morning so decided I would work from home.
I did have back-to-back meetings all day, so what that amounted to working
from home was being plugged in to my work laptop on the VC system and sitting
on the couch in my living room for 8 hours.

So I think the thing that I skipped was the commute, which really was a good
choice.

Meanwhile, Bruno reported an interesting bug on my
[SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat) changes where clients who
disconnect sometimes persist in the connected clients list indefinitely. And,
it turns out being able to change the tempo on the
[SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock) seems like an important
feature to some people.

So yeah, no more time to be sick, or even tired from all that. Forward! It's
on the Internet, so it has to be true.
