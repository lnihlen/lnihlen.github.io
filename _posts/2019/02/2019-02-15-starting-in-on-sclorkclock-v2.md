I was glad to leave work today with enough gas left in the tank to tackle some
of the code behind [SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock) v2,
which was great. I'd like to make some progress on this for the 3-day weekend,
hopefully getting to a rough draft by the coming Monday.

There was also some intimation that {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %}
would be recording this weekend. And, there is the ever-present need for an
{% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} demo. Probably both things should
take priority. But there is a real joy in banging out the SCLOrk code, so
perhaps that will take precedence.

Hilary and I went to a new (to us) restaurant in Soquel, called Pretty Good
Advice. It's in the spot where the old taqueria was that (up until recently)
had the kickass {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} burrito with cactus.

That aside, we were genuinely impressed, although it seems like they just got
set up. They were closing tonight at 7pm, bit odd if you're just going for
breakfast and lunch to stay open that late, bit odd if you're going for the
dinner crowd. Probably has more to do with availability of labor and ingredients
than customer dynamics.

Should be a pretty good weekend!
