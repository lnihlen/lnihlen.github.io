Today felt like it all came in a rush, up early for a typical Monday at work, everything needing attention at once, re-spooling
all of the issues left sitting from Friday back in to top-of-mind. There's also a perf-related deadline at work today, making
folks feel extra pressure to get in what they need to get in before the next phase of the process kicks off tomorrow.

Then I was out a bit early for what was probably an ill-conceived {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} developer roadmap
meeting with Bruno, IMing with people on my phone literally as I'm walking to my car in the work parking lot, letting them
know that I would for sure look over their perf material before going to bed tonight but that I just needed a bit of time
away from the office.

Bruno and I discussed a potential future roadmap for SCLOrk code projects going forward. The fact of the matter is that,
once the big clock refactor is done and landed (which can wait until end of March, so as not to disrupt the student projects
going on right now), I'm not sure there's much in the way of ambitious big projects on the short-to-medium-term horizon.

I have some ideas about things I'd like to build that will set us up for longer-term success, allowing future projects to
scale more easily and take advantage of more existing, established and proven infrastructure, but really we seem largely in
a good place.

The rehearsal was fun but brief. We'll be watching some student pieces for the Music at Noon performance this Wednesday,
where we have the full hour. Then we'll repeat the Public Domain piece as well as what we're tentatively calling
"The Ndef piece," for lack of a better name. It evolved out of a piece with a different name but has grown significantly
far from that that we all just sort of unconciously (at least, on my part it was unconcious) abandoned the old name.

I know I recently blogged that I was feeling the call of those other creative projects, plus also feeling that I would
likely need to make some additional time for work to support my {% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %} show, should
the proposal I put in for the Thursday morning airshift get approved.

So perhaps the ebb of burning SCLOrk work needed is timely. Or, (more likely as these things go), there'll be an urgent
request for a large project dropped in my lap (I typed laptop originally) soon.

The cool part is, either way, I'll be pretty happy.
