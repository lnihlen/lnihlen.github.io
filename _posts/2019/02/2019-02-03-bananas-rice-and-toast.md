Woke up feeling pretty rough around the edges, gastrointestinally speaking.
Had the same worn-down tiredness of yesterday but now with fun additional
bathroom trips as an added bonus.

So, not a lot getting done today, although I did manage to complete and push
a new version of [SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat), with
a lot of UI polish from taking notes and watching students interact with the
software.

I also did start playing a new game Dead Cells, which seems pretty cool. The
levels are sorta randomly generated, and the first playthrough I got a level
that I wasn't able to find a way through, but once I restarted it opened up
and turned in to a lot of fun.

Took 2 more naps today, drinking lots of water. Hopefully I can wake up tomorrow
and everything will be back to normal.
