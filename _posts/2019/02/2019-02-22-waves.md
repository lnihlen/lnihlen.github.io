Perf continues to be an emotional roller coaster. It feels like about every
fifteen minutes I roll a dice on the feelings chart. I can quite honestly say
I don't know if I'm going or coming.

Meanwhile, I was able to assemble one of the bookshelves and clean up some of
the crap that's been hanging around my office since we moved here a few years
ago. This is part of the plan to make that space suitable for frequent work
recording {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %}.

It might be a minute until that's ready to go but I'm glad to be digging in. It
also occurs to me the old joke from grad school, which was about how you could
tell how close someone was to finals, or writing their thesis, by how clean
their room is.

Everything right now has a way of being one or two steps away emotionally from
that center of gravity, the howling vacuum at work. But it's only another
*8 weeks or so*.
