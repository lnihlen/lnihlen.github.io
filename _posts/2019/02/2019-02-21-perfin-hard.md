Did the up early thing for another
[fill-in](https://www.kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58673) on
{% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}. I was stoked to find that Junko & Mattin
LP, that's been a earworm of mine for a while. A fun show.

I spent some of the downtime during the show hacking on the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} clock refactor. I notice my confidence
in that refactor ebbs and flows like the tide, as I encounter different
difficulties. But I'm determined to not start over on a refactor again, no
matter how awkward it gets. I've got a goal to get to a working version by
this coming Monday so time to dig in.

Speaking of digging in, the next 8 hours of the day was spent perfin' hard:

I've spent a great deal of time at work thinking about perf and promo for others
on my team. It's an interesting reminder about how different it is when going
through yourself.

So that's about 12 hours of laptop time, followed by takeout with Hilary,
followed by about another 3 hours or so of - you guessed it - laptop time.
Probably why I don't have like a 2% bodyfat like the Hella guy.

It's hard work but actually feels healthy, trying to form some kind of narrative
over the last few years of my career, sort of retroactively telling myself that
it all made sense. But actually themes emerge, or rather patterns of behavior
that come from the match of things that I'm interested in, things I'm actually
kind of good at, and thing the company needs.

All part of the master plan.
