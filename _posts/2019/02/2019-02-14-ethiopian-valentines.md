Typical wall-to-wall workday, then met with Hilary after work for Valentine's
Day dinner at our favorite Ethiopian restaurant, Zeni. I was surprised to see
that it was fairly calm, feeling much more like a typical Thursday evening than
the Valentine's Day slam one expects eating out. Well, more injera for us, as
they say.

I heard that there was a bad accident on 17 northbound, shutting down the road
again, but by the time we headed home things had cleared up almost entirely.

Work today was a lot of fun. I don't think one can do this often as a lead but
there are times when I pull a lot of people in a room and hammer out a
compromise between 3-5 subteams on a complex plan involving months and months of
work. It's exciting to think about the trade-offs and hear feedback from the
different parts of our bigger team. I also enjoy having the sense of safety
and confidence that we can drag everyone together, get everything on the table,
and call some shots.

After that kind of meeting I usually spend some time feeling nervous that
perhaps some folks feel squashed or pushed around by that kind of meeting style.
So you have to kind of wait until everyone in the room knows me well enough to
know that everything is negotiable, and that there are no wrong answers, it's
free association of ideas and everyone's welcome.

When it works it's straight up rock-and-roll. If I ever make Director at Google,
which is my ultimate goal, I'd love to run a whole team like that, all the time.
