Because of perf right now there is extra emotional energy at work. I think even
people not self-nominating for promo feel it. We're all having to look at
ourselves and others in a critical light. Even for people succeeding there's
just this latent background emotional radiation. *Shit's tense.*

A day of back-to-back meetings is usually intense and now, more so. I can even
feel my own blood is up, too. I groused at a meeting room full of people
yesterday about scheduling. It's like, "how is this their problem?" But I still
heard myself doing it, making the choice to go there.

Perhaps I'm making the same choice I would be making during a regular time of
year. I'd like to think I am, perhaps just the emotional cost of doing the
work has raised. Same bets, higher stakes kind of thing. I'd like to think.

In the middle of a particularly tense meeting, my hands instinctively slip in
to the pouch on the hoodie I was wearing. In there, they brush against two
small doggie treats, stashed from this morning when I walked the dogs and then
forgotten, until then. I am reminded of walking the dogs in the cool, wet
morning air.

Later I texted Hilary a haiku about that moment.
