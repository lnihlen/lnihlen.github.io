I had planned originally to take the entire day off for the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} performance we had scheduled for
the Music At Noon concert series at Santa Clara University. Unlike last time,
we had the whole hour to ourselves, although the non-student types like myself
only played for the last 20 minutes or so.

But, around mid-last-week a perf-related meeting got dropped on my calendar for
the morning, despite the big OoO (Out of Office) block on my calendar all day.
And then I found out on Tuesday that a complete rewrite of my own promo packet
was probably in order. So I un-took the day off, but I was still planning on
trying to perform in the concert at noon, as well as hang around the orchestra
just to make sure all the different software blips and blobs I've written for
them were working properly, and/or to coerce them in to working if they were
not.

10 minutes or so into the performance and I've got three different half-written
emails queued on my phone, my IM is blowing up with multiple different issues.
Folks are wondering if I can attend a 2 PM meeting that is impossible apparently
to reschedule. Another person wants help with an unrelated issue communicating
with a different team, where there's been a misunderstanding and now people
are upset. And yet a third person has a question about their perf, what to do
and how to do it, worrying that they themselves won't get promoted. And, had I
taken the day off like I had originally planned, I probably would have left
my work phone at home, so not even seeing any of the three simultaneous
interruptions. But that's the thing about taking a lunch break, even a long
one, is that it still feels fair to me for folks to ping me on my phone.

So I barely got to hear the student pieces, although I did catch a vague
impression of all three at times and thought all three were awesome and
completely different. It was only later, maybe 2 or 3 hours after the show,
did I realize that I missed the opportunity to hear students performing music
written *using software that I had written.* Quite a missed opportunity, from
that (albiet more self-centered) perspective.

But I don't regret working today, because I did manage to complete the rest of
the perf rewrite. About 2500 words, and at a slightly faster pace than last
time, maybe taking a total of 5 hours or so. Excruciating, but now finished.

And hopefully totally worth it.
