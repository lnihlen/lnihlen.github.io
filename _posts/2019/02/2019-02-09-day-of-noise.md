Headed over the hill in the morning for a Bloco Do Sol Samba rehearsal, back to
Santa Cruz for lunch, and then home. From then my focus has been almost entirely
on getting ready for the Day of Noise git starting tonight. I slimmed the
modules down to one case and finalized which sources I'll be bringing. Then
began the long process of packing and organizing the gear for the trip back
over the hill.

Our bass player is struggling with some kind of ongoing cold so he's going to
bow out tonight. We brought a friend from KFJC in, too, so it should be
interesting to see how the jam takes shape.

We made our way over the hill early to meet the band for dinner at Oren's in
downtown Mountain View. It's been raining on and off all day, with the drive
through the 17 fairly inundated at times. After dinner we headed over to the
station, loaded in the gear in the rain, and prepared for our set.

I ended up fairly happy with the sounds I was making for the noise set. There
was some kind of issue with the effects loop going through the pedals, again
causing issues on the left channel. It makes me wonder if I really was having
a problem with my BigSky, I might have to retest that pedal on a different
setup. I was mostly noisier than I had actually intended to be, with the
drone oscillations even coming in to the system with a certain amount of
distortion and grain.

It's odd because I can feel that I understand one piece of my kit really well,
and think things will be totally predictable. But setting up the modular each
time I might get a sudden flash of insight about how some part of the system
works, or realize that I completely am not getting another part of the system.
Or more likely, both.

I didn't know if we were really finding each other in the mix but overall I had
fun. There's a lot to making a good noise set, perhaps it looks easy with the
person just twisting random knobs and wigging out on the stage, but honestly
the preparation, practice, and also just experience to know what gear is useful
and what you will need to control your sound well enough to make happen what
you want to make happen is really quite difficult.

Grawer said he'd be happy to help me get some gigs for {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %}, and what would
really help is to get a website and some sounds going. So that's the next big
goal. There's also the Wednesday Night Live thing on KZSU, which
{% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} has done a few times and I think
I might be able to convince folks over there to let me come back and solo.

It feels good to know what some concrete next steps might be for this project,
after so many years of indecision and doubt. Of course, finding the time to
take those steps is another matter. But I feel like I've traded an intractable
problem for a much more tractable one. So, progress.
