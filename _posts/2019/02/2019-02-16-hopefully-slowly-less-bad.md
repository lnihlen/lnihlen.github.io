Woke up this morning to head over the hill and rehearse with Bloco do Sol, the
Brazilian Samba group. The clouds broke through the rain for a moment, and it
was beautiful to see the normally brown hills of East San Jose covered in green.

Samba class is fun, we're starting to prepare for a pair of gigs in mid-March,
so a lot of the work is drilling through the changes. The Caixa seems to have
the most simple patterns, probably why folks diverted me to playing it, but
there are still some unison patterns that play through the whole Bateria, and
so that means me, too.

Had some time this afternoon so spent it hoping to accrete some less bad ideas
on the [SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock) refactor. At least
one bright spot was that I realized I could have a per-cohort singleton of each
clock on each machine.

The more code I wrote the further I got from the design doc that I just revised
but sometimes things are like that. You just gotta keep going and hopefully,
things get slowly less bad.

Hoping to have some time tomorrow to set up the music room to record a few
{% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} tracks. I had been kind of holding
the space for {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} rehearsal but I
think it's time to face facts, I think the band is on unofficial hiatus. And,
if not, well, setting up the drums doesn't take too long. I guess that's one
of the things about unofficial hiatus, avoiding the conversation about the
band break means we get to avoid the conversation about the band getting back
together, too.

We had owed a track or two to a friend to contribute to a split. Now, pursuing
my own solo thing, realize what an incredible opportunity that represents. My
hope is that, should I earn my way back to that sort of place by myself, I will
remember this moment and not squander it.
