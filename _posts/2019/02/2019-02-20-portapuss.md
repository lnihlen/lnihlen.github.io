I had a great conversation with Hilary about our longstanding dream duo music
project, {% include tag_link.html tag="portapuss" %}. It turns out we might
have a line on a potential gig at a venue up in Berkeley, and so we're feeling
that we should probably figure out some sounds and agree on a concept, at least
for the first show.

Sometimes it's hard to know where to begin. We had tried to jam a bit but I
think it was too open-ended, like we got lost a bit in the creative
possibilities. Like, I wasn't sure if I should set up my drums or plug in my
{% include tag_link.html tag="modular" %} gear, or both.

So, this time, we agreed that perhaps a more structured approach would be
productive. We talked about a few different bands that we draw inspiration from,
agreed that we would work on some structured songs (versus just free-form jams),
and even suggested some initial concepts for songs.

So that felt great, particularly because I'm becoming increasingly confident
that {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} is on hiatus. Would love to
be wrong about that, and hope that someday I will be, but as for right now all
signs point towards that band being essentially done.

I'm getting up super early tomorrow morning for another fill-in on
{% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}. Despite the brutal 4am wakeup I'm still
excited about the idea of having a permanent airshift there again. Maybe
ask me in 6 months? The other challenge of having a permanent airshift is that
there's a requirement of 8 hours of station work per week in order to support
the airshift. In the past, as part of management, I was able to cover that
easily by all my work as Programming Director. Now that I've rejoined the rank
and file I'm going to need to figure out how best to support that. I have a
few ideas but that will be time away from
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, as well as other projects.

So again, ask me in 6 months. But in the meantime, it's time for bed.
