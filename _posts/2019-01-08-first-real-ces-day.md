I woke up this morning with some good news, Bruno, the conductor of
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, had debuted my code with the student
ensemble without issue, and only one small feature request to prioritize.
There's still lots to implement, and in fact I'm feeling a bit of a time crunch
because of a performance happening later in the month that we'll definitely
want to have a more solid layer of clock logic implemented for, but it was some
definite good news to start the day with. Always glad to hear the thing I
probably spent way too much time on over the break wasn't a total train wreck
the first time it encountered *actual users.*

Then it was off to the showroom floor for the first of many partner meetings,
on the grand opening day of CES for exhibit attendees. I only had about 15
minutes to walk the floor, but I did manage to get a glimpse of somebody
riding a Harley LiveWire on a dyno. I have to say, having seen it in photos
I didn't find the in-person view of it to be nearly as exciting as some of
the photos have made me feel it could be. That's not to say I might not still
seriously consider a demo ride sometime after it comes to market. I'm also
hoping to find enough time, perhaps tomorrow or Thursday, to walk the CES
showroom floor in earnest and find the electric motorcycle section if I can.

As far as personal time goes that was pretty much my day, because the rest of
the time was spent meeting with different folks, then followed by two
back-to-back parties at different casinos with different partners as well.

As a nondrinking vegan who has no real interest in gambling Vegas is mostly
wasted on me but it is good to chat with folks from our partner companies,
refresh relationships with folks I haven't seen in person since last CES,
and discuss generally the business we are all in together. I find this industry
very interesting, so while none of the shop talk is appropriate for this blog
the conversations I have here are very stimulating, and will fuel lots of
internal discussion for the weeks and months to come.

I enjoy my job. Not every day, and certainly not every task I must perform as
part of my duties. But today was a largely good day, and I'm glad I came.
