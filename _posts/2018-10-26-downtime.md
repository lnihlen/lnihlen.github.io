Tomorrow I am packing up my stuff and heading into the woods. Gotta say, I'm
fighting a bit of a temptation to just download Red Dead Redemption 2 on the
PS4 and jam on that for the weekend. Hilary is coming back to town Monday, and
she likely won't be traveling out of town again on her own for at least 6
months, so this weekend really does represent something pretty rare, like
once-in-a-blue-moon rare.

I think if I want I can always come back on Sunday. If that really is what I
want best I think that's fine. But I want to try and get out there for at least
one night.

About today I have little to say. I still don't get enough sleep during the work
week. Lots of time spent this week working on recruiting, trying to fill various
roles on my team. I find that kind of work emotionally exhausting. I think I
have one fairly firm commitment. Many to go.

Oh, and one of my cats is missing. She's been gone significantly longer than
what I would consider an extraordinarily long retreat for her. I've walked the
property, put out food. Hil let the pet tracker company know she's gone missing.
I'm putting out word with the neighbors. Sometimes, with cats, you don't get
any closure. I hope she's alright.
