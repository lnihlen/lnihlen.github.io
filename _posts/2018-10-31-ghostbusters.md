Halloween night here, got home and helped Hilary get the costumes on the doggos
for a photo shoot:

Then we finished up Ghostbusters, which had been hanging over from last night.
Super tired so I'll keep it short. Going to spend a few minutes before bed
working on advancing the PXE boot, to see if I can get the cluster booting
that.
