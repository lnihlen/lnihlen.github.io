Hil and I got up at 5 to head to LAX, drop off the rental car, and fly to
Chicago O'Hare. Got in a little work on
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} and
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}. Then sat in a taxi for 90
minutes to travel the 15 miles from the airport to the hotel. Going to
remember this the next time I think the traffic situation in the Bay Area is
uniquely terrible.

We got in to the W, grabbed a salad, processed the days email for a minute,
then I went for an great quick run along the waterfront. Wow I know where I'm
running for the rest of the trip! Saw lots of runners, paddleboarders, open
water swimmers, doggies, and a beautiful sunset over the lake.

Joined the work team for a late dinner, then off to bed. With the two hour time
difference and the four hour flight that was pretty much my whole day.
