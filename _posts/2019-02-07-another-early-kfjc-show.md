Got up early to do another [fill-in](https://kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58568)
for {% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}. Then work all day, dinner, then
home. It was cool this morning to have some time between sets this morning to
hack on some {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. I feel like I got out of
the weeds a bit on the [SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock)
refactor by writing some "aspirational code," some code to describe how I'd like
to be able to use the new version of the clock.

Starting to see the schedule backing up to the point that I'm going to have to
pick some priorities. And the outside-of-work-hours work is also going to start
to demand a certain level of prioritization that I haven't been giving it in
the more balanced 50% of the work year outside of perf.

And on that note, I'm headed straight to bed.
