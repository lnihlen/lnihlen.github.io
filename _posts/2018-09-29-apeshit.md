Had a little time this morning to hack on {% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %}
and I spent it on getting [Halide](http://halide-lang.org/) added to
`third_party` and compiling. It doesn't like Gentoo's normal way of installing
`llvm` because all of the llvm libraries in Gentoo are shared objects, but
Halide would like to be able to redistribute llvm in its own static library,
in order so that it can JIT-compile the various functions passed to it at
runtime. There's a note about Gentoo `clang` static libs basically explaining
that they aren't built for Gentoo and break something else in the system if
you try to build them. So I was contemplating building my own llvm from source,
which seemed like a lengthy project.

Thankfully I found a Gentoo overlay that builds Halide, and learned that I can
use `cmake` to compile it, and that `cmake` will take an argument to force
Halide to build a dynamic library for itself, allowing it to use the llvm `.so`
libraries as well. So yay.

Then it was time to head over the hill for some Ethiopian food for dinner,
followed by a series of queues in order to see Beyonce and Jay-Z perform
for their On The Run 2 tour at Levi Stadium. Hil's been a certified megafan
since Lemonade, if not earlier, and I certainly enjoyed myself at the Formation
tour and so thought this one might be fun too.

DJ Khaled opened, and introduced Naughty By Nature, who did a short set which
was fun. Then Jay-Z and Bey took over my world for a few hours. I think this
is as close as I'm going to get to experiencing her legendary Coachella
performance, and so must be satisfied. I haven't listened to much Jay-Z so
while I enjoyed his solo performances I didn't have the familiarity with his
material that I did with the Carters material or Beyonce's own work.

Still, though, it was a pretty fun night. Next time she's in San Jose, should
she decide to grace us with her presence I'll be sure to try and catch her again.
