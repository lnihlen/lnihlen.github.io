The KZSU Day of Noise is fast approaching and I'm working on tightening up
the set of modules I want to use, along with the other signal sources, racking
them in the portable module case, getting everything screwed down and ready
to go. I still need to go get another folding table as the one I normally use
is now semi-permanently deployed for another purpose.

I'll be performing with folks from {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %},
Hilary, and friends, but I'm treating this as an opportunity to work towards
defining that solo set.

I had picked up some 1U modules that fit in the top of the Intellijel cases I
have, in order to free up some room in the main rack area for additional
modules. But, it turns out, the additional room is causing me more stress. I
think the available capacity is now in that awkward place where there's ample
room for all of the modules I can't imagine living without, but not enough room
for all the secondary might-be-useful-some-of-the-time modules, let alone the
this-sounded-cool-once-but-I-haven't-learned-quite-how-to-use-it-fully modules.

Think probably the next step is to spend some time tomorrow and Sunday
rehearsing with the setup I have, identifying some plans for patches,
documenting those, and confirming the layout of the modules in the rack.

I think an {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} set is much more likely
to have less drone and probably more noise, but otherwise much of what I'm
developing is likely to be transferable. I have to say I'm really excited to
be making some progress on this.

There's more work owed on {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, and I also
have a special Bloco Do Sol rehearsal tomorrow with a special guest instructor,
so it's going to be a weekend cram-jammed with music. Great!
