I came in to work a bit late so I could get over to the Branciforte Fire Station
and vote. They had one electronic voting machine, which I was allowed to get in
line for, but the person voting there was taking a very *comfortable* time in
voting so after waiting for around 10 minutes I gave up and went with the paper
ballot.

The poll workers were excited about the turnout, saying there had been a big
rush right as the polls opened, and they were already well ahead on the signin
sheet than former election days at that time.

Then work came in to focus and the rest of the day is kind of a blur (hah!).
Now I'm home with Hil watching Dick Tracy, the latest in our Lynda Thompson
project, and I'm occasionally hitting refresh on the Guardian's election
tracking website.

Glad to see higher voter turnout.
