Long work day followed by long work night with homework keeping me up past
normal bedtimes plus still getting over that cold. So will have to keep this
short. We're leaving town on Friday for a friend of Hilary's wedding in Palm
Springs, and I'm on vacation starting Friday too, so it's the last working
week of the year. I think when we were in the teens of work days remaining I
was keeping a count, then things got crazy again and so it was all a blur again
until I got to *2* working days left in the year.

So that's something.

I just wish it didn't feel like we were all trying to cram in about 2-3 weeks of
work into the next few days.
