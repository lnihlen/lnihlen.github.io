Was starting to feel really worn down, like maybe I was getting sick last night,
so I opted to sleep in a bit instead of heading over the hill for Samba practice.
Been feeling just tired and run down all day, including even taking a nap in
the afternoon for a few hours.

It's been raining all day and, for a brief moment, we had a heavy hailstorm,
reminding me more of weather in my home state of New Mexico than here in
Northern California. Tomorrow looks to be raining all day too.

So not a great day for getting stuff done but a good day to rest and recover. I
*did* manage to make some more progress wiring up and screwing down all of the
modules for the {% include tag_link.html tag="egregious" %} live set I'm putting
together. There's a lot of different options for the modules I have going, and
I feel like each jam I'm just uncovering some small subset of the rig's
capabilities.

For a live set I might leave things pre-patched, have some sort of general game
plan of what is patched where and what sounds I want to bring in when. But it's
also fun to build up a patch while performing, particularly with the in-ear
monitors letting me hear what particular sounds (when jamming with others) that
I'm actually creating.

I had a couple of issues with modules installed incorrectly or just needing a
bit of TLC. I also still really need a folding table. And perhaps tomorrow I
will take the time to record some of the jams. It was great fun, however, to
fire everything up.

Now, back to bed.
