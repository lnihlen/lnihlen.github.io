The rain snarled the commute this morning, and there were plenty of cars on the
road. Made it in late to a full office. Today was my boss's first day back in
office of the new year, and with everyone else back from their various vacations
it's really starting to feel like the regular routine. I keep plenty busy with
my normal routine, and it's good to feel the larger engine of the team kicking
over and heading towards a good steady lope.

Then it was time for my first {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal
of the year. We're working on the piece for our next performance involving a lot
of samples taken from different songs in different eras. I was glad to see that
there were minimal changes required to get the refactored
[SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat) working, only one little
patch to fix the defaults I had set up to work with the old code and had
forgotten to update.

So, a long day, but positive experiences all around. And super glad to get going
and do it again tomorrow.
