There are many sides to this, some of them bitter, and some of them incredibly
rewarding, but I think most folks would agree that the advance of computer
technology has been one of revolutionary change. It's been a big attraction
to technology for me, in fact. It's probably naive and arrogant, but there are
times that I feel like working in technology represents a real opportunity to
break old patterns of human behavior. Or maybe not. Maybe as I get older I
believe less of the hype there. Or maybe it's more like that technology really
is just tools, mechanical advantage, and doesn't particularly change our
fundamental nature as people, good and evil, but rather it's a multiplier of
both.

In any event, my point isn't to debate the merits of technology, but rather to
point out that a lot of folks in technology have this as a value, the idea that
if you are working hard that is probably a bad sign, you need to be working
smart instead. Or maybe something like working really hard at working smart.

I think I've internalized as a value that if you are just working hard, and
working hard for a long time at the same thing, and nothing is changing, that
you are somehow not doing something right. Like I develop this sneaking
suspicion that I am headed down a career dead end, because I am not working
on a "hockey stick" sort of curve where eventually the relationship between
effort and reward is going to go superlinear in a big way. I think for a lot
of people in this industry, even if they never see the near-vertical part of
the hockey stick curve, will be willing to spend a long time and a lot of
effort on various different efforts that are sublinear investment, meaning
working super hard for not very much reward, in the hopes that one of those
efforts will blow up. This is seen as noble and courageous.

But I think this is a fiction and a trap. There are many other professions which
have internalized a natural skepticism towards "shortcuts," and develop among
the successful in the field a healthy regard for, if not active celebration of,
toil.

By not valuing that kind of regular hard work I think we've ignored a lot of
the contributions of our colleagues that are consistently getting the job done,
unglamorous bits and all, and taking care of the 80% of the program that doesn't
need to be written by experts but just really needs to be written.

I have worked hard my entire career, and I'm only halfway through. My intention
is to learn how to value that, celebrate it even, despite the fact that my
industry and myself often can't often even see it.
