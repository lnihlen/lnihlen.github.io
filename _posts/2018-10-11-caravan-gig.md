Took the truck in to work, after loading it with my drums. After work Hil and
I grabbed a bite to eat at Walia and then headed over to the Caravan Lounge to
load in for the {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} gig.

It was a loud and sloppy gig. Made several mistakes, probably even dropped the
beat once or twice, but I never felt like I was too outside of the groove.

Then it was off to home, to finish some homework, and to write this. Hil is
watching the Office on TV, season 3. They really got a lot out of the old Pam
and Jim dynamic.
