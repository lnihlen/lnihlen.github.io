More meetings today, including one with a media technology company in which the
demo giver was brought to tears by something I'm sure they've demoed multiple
times for the past few days. It left me doing yet another uncomfortable personal
inventory trying to discern if I'm dead inside emotionally or just deeply
depressed, or why I had such a different experience of that demo than the demo
giver.

Had a bit more time to walk the CES floor, which I frankly found exhausting. I
have no business calling me back there tomorrow, although I have some free time
tomorrow afternoon. I never take naps but after getting back to the hotel today
I took a two hour nap before dinner.

I still haven't seen the whole electric motorcycle section but that might have
to wait. We'll see how I feel after my meeting load passes tomorrow.

Before dinner I met some colleagues while they were drinking at bar inside the
Wynn called Parasol Down. I made a joke that that's sounds like the name of a
Mary Poppins war movie and I tell you I haven't been that satisfied with myself
for making a joke in quite a while.

The almost script writes itself on that one.
