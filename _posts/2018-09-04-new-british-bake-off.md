Easily top five for me, if not the absolute favorite, is
[The Great British Bake Off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off).
Hil and I have watched a lot of cooking shows, including probably a person-year
of Chopped, but nothing can touch the Bake Off. There's so much to like on this
show, from the hosts Mel and Sue to the judges Paul and Mary. I love the
decorum of the contestants, their work ethic and creative flair.

Almost everyone on the cast has changed for Season (or Series as they say) 8,
leaving only Paul Hollywood. I'm surprised how much I like the new season,
however. I was expecting I wouldn't be as much of a fan. In particular Noel
Fielding, a favorite actor of mine from
[The IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd), really makes the
new lineup sing. And then there's all the amazing bakers, just as before,
with their struggles, ambitions, risks, fears, joys, triumphs, and disasters.
Hil also likes the quick shots of lambs, ducks, and other British garden/farm
life between scenes.

On the {% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} front I started work on the
`State::Apply` method but made no significant progress after completing my
work homework.
