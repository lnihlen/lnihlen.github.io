First day back at work, I was dragging my feet a bit this morning getting
started but once I got there things were fine. Still about half-staffed at work
this week so the place had a bit of that ghost-town feeling but that means no
parking crunch or trying to find an empty bathroom stall after lunch. It was
great to reconnect with the people who were at work, with lots of stories about
fun vacations, or restful time at home with family, and shared treats from
points abroad.

I got home with enough time to plug in some of the bits that I've moved into
my office and make some sounds. I heard that
{% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} plus a few invited guests might
be playing a noise set at the end of January, so I've been tinkering a bit with
some of the sounds I could be making. I had fun plugging MIDI into the EuroRack
parts and running some stuff through the modular.

I'm even just trying to figure out what kind of gear to use for rehearsal, or
performance, et cetera. I always feel like I have to stop and go and dig around
for some cables, or a power supply, or some such kind of gear in order to get
the things connected that need to be connected so I can hear them. Whenever I
think of a situation when I need a cable that I don't have I try to remember
to pick one or two up so that, come the next time I need one of those, I perhaps
have one laying around.

I'm hoping that, over time, the different kinds of audio cabling and
interconnect gear I have will have a cumulative effect and these kinds of
troubles start to settle down. Of course, that sort of depends on me having
like a well-organized, systematic approach to organizing the gear and cabling
that I have.

Maybe it's like setting up a home gym, which is a huge investment of time,
energy, and money, but that upfront cost is paid back again and again every
time you use it.
