Woke up last night around 2am with every confidence that I was going to have to
call in to work sick this morning. I've been sleeping on and off all day. Hilary
made Green Chile Stew for dinner, which was an awesome treat for feeling so sick.

I have made a small amount of progress on the Raspberry Pi cluster, I got `ssh`
working without login, added `sudo`, and did some tinkering with `pssh` so that
I got tone from all of the Pi boards going into a multichannel recorder.

Next up is actually coding up a version of the networked clock. I've been
reading through the code of the Utopia `BeaconClock` as well as about NTP and
how some of the networking clock algorithms keep synchronization system. One
important thing to spot is the use of the `Scheduler` class, which I expect
will allow me to sneak in timing adjustments on a running clock.

Likely to happen as soon as I have enough energy to sit at a desk for longer
than a few minutes at a time.
