Over my vacation in the UK I read
[a series of interviews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17713683-in-the-field)
of field recordists. I found it a fascinating and inspiring read, and in
particular there were a few artists interviewed that were doing field recordings
using antennae, or electromagnetic field recording. There are so many uncharted
sonic territories out there, sometimes hiding in plain sight, like with the EM
spectrum.

I've been getting some odd voice mails, too, like most people. A couple of them
are low-fi recordings of Chinese singing. Also Hil has gotten a few spam
voicemails that are nothing but eerie static for 5+ minutes, sounding like the
material studied by
[EVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voice_phenomenon) enthusiasts.

In the vein of exploring new sonic territories I had the idea of building a
website, audio stream, and possibly related smartphone applications to allow
for the harvesting of spam voicemails for digestion and re-interpretation into
a spam voicemail sonic space.

Thus the Phone Spam Hashery idea was incubated. I envision the project along the
following course:

* Minimum Viable
  * App (or documented, easy process) to upload voicemails from your smartphone
    to the server.
  * System to blend uploaded audio files to an interesting whole and stream over
    the web.
  * Web page with basic instructions and access to the audio stream.
* Incremental Version
  * Phone number users can call to upload live recordings for addition to the
    hashery, or to listen to the hashery over the phone.
* Advanced Version
  * If you mistakenly pick up a spam call, some way to add in the hashery app
    to connect the spam call directly to the hashery, live!

Work already underway on the MVP. Of course, I add this to the *long* list of
other projects that I am actively tinkering with, so progress may be slow.
