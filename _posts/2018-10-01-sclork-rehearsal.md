This was the second rehearsal of {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}, but
the first I was able to attend, having been in Chicago for the last one. We
have
[a gig](http://www.southfirstfridays.com/2018/09/october-5-2018-south-first-fridays-art-walk-street-mrkt/) on Friday, although I don't see us anywhere on the website. SCLork is
performing all night, essentially, taking some breaks but probably doing
at least two sets.

One of the pieces, called *Tocatta*, is all about processing audio gathered from
a contact mic attached to various things. It's really fun to try out different
objects with the contact mic, and develop various instruments in concert with
others in the ensemble.

The other piece is an adaptation of
[In a Large Open Space](http://www.frogpeak.org/unbound/tenney/InALargeOpenSpace.pdf?lbisphpreq=1),
using simple `Ndefs` containing multiples of the fundamental frequency, which is
a low F. Cool to hear the different drones, changing wave shapes, and then
eventually breaking the rules and starting to make other sounds. There's
something so magical from simple frequency modulation, the remarkable variety
of different tones one can get from a couple of sinusoids.

We went from a little after 6 pm until 9, but the time just flew by. It was a
lot of fun. Looking forward to Friday.
