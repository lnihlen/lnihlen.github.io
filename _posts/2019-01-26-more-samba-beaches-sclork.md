I think if I keep this up I'll need to create a new tag for the Brazilian Samba
group I've been rehearsing with. Up early this morning to head over the hill
for another rehearsal with those folks. I'm still sort of waiting for the shoe
to drop where they give me some kind of audition, or tell me it will be a few
months of practice before I'm really ready to play in a gig with them, which
would be fine really. But everyone is super nice, friendly, supportive, and
inclusive. We're talking about doing sectionals, with the first Caixa (the
snare drum I'm playing) sectional happening this Tuesday. It turns out I've
been doing the sticking wrong on one of our pieces, anyway, so I'm thinking
a sectional will definitely be useful.

I hit up San Jose BMW Motorcycles on the way home, first to get some motorcycle
pants that fit me in my current size, but also in the hopes that the sales staff
might have a brochure, or even just a hint, of what kind of bike Zero is
supposedly going to announce. But no such luck, while the salesperson I was
working with was all to happy to engage in speculation, that's all it was,
speculation.

Grabbed some Ethiopian takeout for lunch with Hilary and then back over the
hill to meet her at home and eat it. I noticed a pronounced thickening of the
17 traffic around Los Gatos and Lexington, which is not a great sign to be
seeing that so early. You learn pretty early on as part of life in Santa Cruz
that the peninsula-to-beach traffic on a beautiful weekend day is not to
be trifled with, in either direction. I am feeling like I'm really going to need
some kind of plan about how to cope with that if I want to continue to play
Saturday mornings with these folks.

Hence, the motorcycle pants.

Hil and I hit the beach with the doggies, then it was home and time for me to
whip up some {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} lasagna. Hilary and I took
a crack at the Switch version of Super Mario Bros U. The co-op mode is pretty
fun. And that reminded me that Zelda 2 is now in the Nintendo Online game
section. So I had a blast grinding on that for a minute.

I pushed a few minor updates to the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
project, we have a performance for that scheduled this coming Wednesday. I'm
taking the day off from work, to avoid complications around a midday performance
and trying to get from and back to work in some sort of reasonable time frame.

We've been testing the [SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD) Quark
pretty extensively, so fingers crossed things don't blow up during a
performance.
