We had an offsite today to the nearby movie theater, walking distance Google
campus, to see the new Fantastic Beasts movie Crimes of Grindelwald. It was a
cool treat. That theater as remodeled, with large recliners inside covered in
faux leather.

I think this one has a very different tone from the first, much more grimdark,
much more about the people with only a few fantastic beasts actually
relevant to the story. It also seems packed with lore, and very little
exposition of much of it, either assuming we remembered it from the first movie,
the larger Harry Potter franchise, or that we missed it but it wasn't
necessarily material to the basic plot.

I do believe that for some of my colleagues this was their first exposure to
*anything* Harry Potter, and I can't imagine that they got a lot out of that
film. It felt a lot like the middle movie in a trilogy, lots of chess pieces
being moved around, and some continuation of story established in the first
movie, but very little to grab ahold of in this film that could work on its
own.

Hil is somewhat interested in seeing it in theaters and I would be glad to see
it again soon, I bet there'd be a lot more I'd pick up on a rewatch.

Meanwhile the smoke is getting thicker.
