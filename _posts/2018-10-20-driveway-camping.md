My birthday present for myself this past April was to get a pop-up camper for
my pickup truck. The genesis of this idea for the camper sprung out of two
separate occasions.

The first occasion was the winter of 2017. I live in Santa Cruz and work in
Mountain View, which means every working day I get up and drive over Highway
17 through the Santa Cruz Mountains. This is a twisty two-lane road, often
carved out of the mountainside. During the unusually wet winter of 2017 there
were multiple landslides and tree falls across that road, which meant that it
was closed for multiple days a few times. Closure of the 17 adds easily an
hour to my commute, and that is diverting to single-lane, sketchier roads
through the mountains.

One night, after an all-day rain, I was heading home in my hybrid Honda Accord.
I got notification from Wayze while headed towards the 17 that it had been
closed. I was diverted to first one and then another side road, with more and
more of them closed. I was deep in the mountains and had no cell connectivity,
meaning that I no longer could be certain if I had a valid path through. I
ended up stuck at on a road with a tree down across it, and a long line of
cars pooling behind me as each of us arrived at what seemed to be the only
remaining way through the mountains to home.

While I was trying to negotiate a path through the backed up cars, to turn
around, a large 4x4 truck pulled up and a man jumped out of it, carrying a
fire ax. He wasted no time but started to hack up the tree across the road.
A few other folks got out and started to spell him on the tree, or help drag
debris off the road. Within a short while we had a large truck-size hole cut
in the downed tree, and the line of cars started snaking through it immediately,
lead by that giant 4x4.

Well, we had gotten no more than a quarter mile down the road when the lead
truck was stopped once again, this time by a washout across the road. For about
50 feet the road was covered in roughly 18 inches of loose soil, rocks, and
tree parts. Again, the man jumped out of his 4x4 and started to tackle the
bigger pieces of rock, this time with a flat-bladed shovel.

By now a few other folks had turned up, and a small digging party begin to form,
with each of us trying our best to haul rocks, clear soil, and generally make
a path through the washout. But with the continual raining and the loose soil
it was clear it was going to be very slow going to get the mud cleared out
enough that a nice efficient hybrid vehicle with a low ground clearance, like
mine, would be able to get through. Eventually the higher ground clearance
vehicles were able to get through and the man with the 4x4 drove on and away.
A short while later some folks from PG&E showed up with a backhoe and were able
to clear enough of the dirt that the cars could drive through as well.

I arrived home that night after midnight, covered in mud and exhausted. I think
that was the genesis of the idea of getting my own 4x4 vehicle, perhaps loaded
with a fire ax, small chainsaw, and flatblade shovel come another winter like
that.

The second occasion was the most recent

{% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} has played this a few times in the
past, but this most recent time we appeared as Grawer's side project name 60Hz.
The drive out is always sketchy, so another reminder about how occasionally I
really still do have a use for a track with high ground clearance. Then we
slept on the ground. I don't think sleeping on the ground in your 40s is the
same as sleeping on the ground in your teens or 20s. This never used to bother
me. But I started thinking about some kind of RV situation, for the next time
the band was going to camp and play at some music festival in the middle of
nowhere. But an RV would have completely foundered on those goat trails out
to the site. So we arrive at the popup camper idea.

Half fun luxury camping accessory, half response plan for any of a number of
disaster scenarios I can imagine for where I live. If we start getting rains
like we got two winters ago, I think I'm loading the camper into my truck,
and driving with it to work each day. If I get word that my options back home
are limited, I can head home. If I get stuck, I have a warm bed to lay in,
a change of clothes, food to cook for breakfast, even a toilet and a hot shower.

Each wildfire season here I wonder if this is going to be the one that destroys
our home. Or there's always the possibility of a major earthquake. I may not
be prepared for all of these situations but having the camper around at least
makes me feel like I have options. It's not lost on me that my best mitigation
for a variety of climate change related catastrophes is the purchase of a large
diesel truck. I do my best to limit driving of the truck for when a truck is
actually needed, like I'm when hauling gear or the camper.

But the camper has sat in my front yard since April, unused. With Hilary gone
I finally decided to break it in by myself. Next weekend I'm headed to China
Camp, east of Big Sur, for a couple of nights out in the woods alone. I'll be
bringing my laptop, but may be posting blogs retroactively as I doubt there's
any cellular coverage over there.

The folks who sold me the camper, when taking me through a brief orientation of
it, recommended that we first camp in the camper when it is parked in the
driveway. That way, if anything missing or unusable was discovered, or if it
took additional time to figure out how to use any of the functions of the
camper, it would be right outside home. So I'm doing that tonight. I'm going to
put the dogs down for bed in a bit, brush my teeth, then grab my pillow and
walk down my driveway to spend the night in the camper. I'm genuinely excited
to try it out, and when I was setting it up a bit earlier I was kicking myself
that I had taken so long to get around to doing this.
