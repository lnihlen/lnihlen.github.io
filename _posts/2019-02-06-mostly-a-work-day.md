Work demanded almost all of my attention today and I was just fine with it. I
work on stuff that matters to me personally, and making decisions around what
to do and how to do it can be really satisfying.

So that's where my focus was for most of the day. When I got home Hilary had
asked that we review the setup of our gear for Saturday and I thought that was
a good idea so we set up all of her gear first and did a sound check. We
uncovered a faulty pedal so it was good to be able to detect that now and see
about possibly swapping it out or just doing without.

Then I went through my own setup and discovered a couple of issues in my gear
too. Specifically, I have a Strymon Big Sky reverb pedal and I was dismayed
to discover that the left channel isn't working. So.. bummer! Looks like I'll
be finding room in the case for the good ol' Clouds module once again.. Such
is the life of an music gear hoarder.

Up early tomorrow for another fill-in at {% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}.
Looking forward to the quiet time, and to filling it up with noise!
