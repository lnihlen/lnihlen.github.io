Got up early, worked out, headed in to work. I had an interesting discussion
with my manager about perspective about work and the current state of my team.
I think it's funny how sometimes it's easy to mistake an internal feeling for
an external reality, which then re-enforces the internal feeling.

Put more specifically, because I'm spread so thin at work I've been mostly
thinking tactically, feeling very embattled and having to move from urgent
problem to urgent problem. That's been the reality of my work for some time now,
but that doesn't mean it's the reality for the team that I manage, or the
broader team that we're on, or my personal life, etc etc.

Realizing that, being able to step back from my own personal experience and not
project it across the entire universe surrounding me, is something that I
usually try to do a bit better.

How often the fundamentals of mindfulness must be re-learned. Or unlearned.
