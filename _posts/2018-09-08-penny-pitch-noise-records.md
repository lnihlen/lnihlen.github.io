Up until recently I was the Programming Director at [KFJC](http://kfjc.org) and
had a regular show under the DJ name Muad'Dib. I mostly played noise, ambient,
and experimental. I got burned out as manager and resigned.Hil started at the
station only a short while after I did. She's still active, keeping a weekly
show in the same time slot for years.

The station is starting its annual fund raising drive soon, and they kick it off
usually with a few Penny Pitch events, which are live broadcasts from various
record stores around the Bay Area. Listeners are encouraged to show up and dump
spare change (or bills) into a change bucket, rub elbows with DJs, buy some
merch, and of course visit the hosting record store.

Hilary has been one of the live DJs for a couple years running now and her gig
was this afternoon. So we drove up to San Francisco to
[Noise Records](https://www.sanfrancisconoise.com/) for her to do her bit. It's
always cool to explore a new record store although I was surprised to discover
that there was no noise or experimental section on offer. But if you like jazz,
soul, or classic rock and have a record player they've got you covered.

It was good to see some station folks after having stepped out of that org for
a minute. And I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. To do it properly
requires a bigger time investment that I really have free time to make. Not sure
when that will change. But KFJC is an incredibly special and rare thing in
the music world today, and I'm proud to have been involved, and proud to support
Hil in this endeavor.
