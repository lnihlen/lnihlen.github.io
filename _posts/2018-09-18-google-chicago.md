It's not for me to say why I'm in Chicago in particular but I'm glad I'm here.
The Google Chicago office is beautiful, and while I have very little time to
explore the rest of the city it feels like a real privilege to get to be here.

Caught in my ear today:

Our office here is in an old refrigerated building, so think big columns and
thick walls of concrete. But also floor-to-ceiling windows, which I assume are
a retrofit, giving plenty of light and exposing beautiful Chicago city views.

I appreciate the Google offices in skyscrapers, because although it can be a
big office with a lot of people it still feels more intimate than our main
campus, because its all stacked on top of itself instead of spread out among
many buildings.

Back to the hotel room late, and up early for a long day of meetings back in
that office.
