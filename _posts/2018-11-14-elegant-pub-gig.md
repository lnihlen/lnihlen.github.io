Had a Wednesday night {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %} gig in a bar
in a strip mall in East San Jose called The Elegant Pub. These are one of my
favorite kind of gigs. The crowd consists mostly of the other bands and their
friends, so they are super supportive and engaged. Yeah you are staying up
super late on a work night and getting no sleep but there's another kind of
energy you get from playing a gig like that.

Right off the bat the security guard at the door asked us to turn down. That's
the second gig in a row (after Saturday night at the Blue Lagoon) that we've
had to do that. I'm beginning to spot a trend here..

We were basically playing in the diner attached to a bar. They had a gazebo in
the center of the place. I genuinely believe there should be more indoor
gazebos. Hil and I remembered our courtin' days, with much time spent in diners
just like that, mostly eating steak, eggs, and hashbrowns, before I went
{% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %}. I'm sure both my cholesterol level and
the various animals exploited for the meal enjoy the break.

Good times with the band, it's great to be playing gigs. I hope I never take
it for granted.
