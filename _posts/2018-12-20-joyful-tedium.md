While we did have business over the hill this morning it wrapped up quickly
and Hilary and I returned home before 11. Then it was just downtime, which is
excellent. Most of the threads I've been following at work wrapped up today by
1 or 2 in the afternoon, so I've officially tuned out of the work email stream
mostly today too.

As a result the day was actually a bit tedious, which was lovely. Hil took a
lengthy nap on the couch while I alternated between grinding out a few more
levels in Phantasy Start 2 on the Switch and hacking on the various
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} projects I have going. It occurred
to me yesterday during the coffee shop hackathon that the best way to distribute
the SCLOrk code that's close to production is to make use of the excellent
Supercollider `Quark` system, hosting from public repositories on my GitHub.

I ordered a few new parts for the forever-ongoing Linux workstation, mostly to
support some higher performance around the
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} Halide code I've been writing, and of
course haven't gotten back to in some time, having been completely distracted
by my SCLOrk obligations.

Grawer, the guitarist in {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %}, dropped
by to pick up gear in the evening, we have a show tomorrow night at the
Starry Plough in Oakland. I had just popped our homemade
{% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} pizzas out of the oven so they stayed
to share some dinner with us.

So in other words, it was a lovely, uneventful day.
