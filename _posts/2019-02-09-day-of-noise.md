Headed over the hill in the morning for a Bloco Do Sol Samba rehearsal, back to
Santa Cruz for lunch, and then home. From then my focus has been almost entirely
on getting ready for the Day of Noise git starting tonight. I slimmed the
modules down to one case and finalized which sources I'll be bringing. Then
began the long process of packing and organizing the gear for the trip back
over the hill.

Our bass player is struggling with some kind of ongoing cold so he's going to
bow out tonight. We brought a friend from KFJC in, too, so it should be
interesting to see how the jam takes shape.
