All-day evaluation and reporting meeting, followed by a short break, and then
a user study in-office until late evening, then a team dinner. I managed to
remember to snap a picture of the office this morning before heading in to
the conference room where I spent the rest of the entire day.

I did get time during the break to open up and investigate one of the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} pieces that Bruno sent out to the
members. I missed the first rehearsal this Monday so have some make up/catch up
to do.

I must have looked a bit strange to my colleagues, taking the time to geek out
on {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} with my personal laptop and
some headphones, while everyone else on the team was trying to spend some time
away from the confroom where we spent 10 hours in meetings today! Super excited
to figure out how to contribute meaningfully to that in the future.

Then it was time for late-night {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} tacos,
along with an interesting/odd-but-tasty blended guacamole with pine nuts and
garlic. Dug everything but the texture.

Chicago continues to impress, making me sad I have so little time to explore
it. Hilary returned to the hotel with stories of her trip through the
incredible Art Institute of Chicago. One of my favorite things to do with her
is to go to a museum, and this one sounds amazing.

We'll have to come back.
