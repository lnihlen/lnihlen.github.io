Early day for workout, commuted in to work, back-to-back meetings all day,
commuted home, ate dinner, homework until 11:30. So very little to talk about
exciting today, except we did catch the next movie in our Dwayne Johnson
filmography project,
[Central Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence),
which was surprisingly delightful. Dwayne is a really good comic actor, I really
enjoy seeing him in comedic roles. Lots of funny moments, and some typical
action shooty fun stuff too.

Moana is coming up soon, which is a favorite for both me and Hilary already.
