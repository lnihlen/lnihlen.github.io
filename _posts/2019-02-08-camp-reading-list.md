I'm taking a class on Field Recording in May. I hadn't heard a lot of info
about it, other than a general outline, until last night when they sent out
a sort of syllabus. There are about 10 books on the list of recommended reading.
Out of respect for the teacher's intellectual property I will not be posting
the list here but I have to say if the diversity of topics and depth of
scholarship on display in the syllabus are any indication of the actual
coursework on offer we are in for a pretty exceptional experience.

Advice I've given many a junior programmer (that honestly hasn't aged entirely
well) is that whenever they meet a software engineer that they admire to take
careful note of their bookshelf. The ubiquity of digital books, Google search,
and service sites like Stack Overflow have changed the landscape but most of the
outstanding programmers I've worked with had a "working set" of books close to
their desk, used largely as reference material, which were often the same set
of books by which they had learned their trade. That meant that they were
truly useful books, and being able to pick out the few gems of useful books
from the glut of low-quality programming books out there on the market could
be a fast track to gaining the hard-earned skills of a master.

So it feels like a gift indeed to survey this bibliographic landscape,
especially since the subject matter is so far from my own centers of experience.
Now I begin to feel truly excited about the possibility of attending this
course.

Of course, there is also the new challenge of finding time to consume roughly
a dozen textbooks between now and May. Given my other current obligations,
and the strongly positive derivative of work load right now, I'm seriously
contemplating trying to switch to the Google Shuttle for my commute some work
days, just so I can have a few hours each day of uninterrupted study time.
*Shit's getting real,* as they say, but in the best imaginable way.
