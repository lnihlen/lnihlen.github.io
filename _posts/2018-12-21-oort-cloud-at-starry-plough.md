Got to sleep in a bit this morning, particularly good since I'm expecting we'll
be up late, what with the gig at the Starry Plough in Berkeley tonight. Since we
had time I made us waffles and {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} grain
sausage for breakfast.

Hil and I started our traditional Christmas-time re-watching of the Harry Potter
movies. We saw Die Hard last night, a friend's favorite Christmas movie. Hilary
hadn't seen it before and was surprised by how much she enjoyed it.

Feeling the need but not likely to have time to work on the couple of
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} code projects I have going right now.
Particularly with converting them in to quarks. It's mostly straightforward
programming for now but I'm beginning to feel like there's a lot of it to be
done.

We sat in rush hour traffic for quite a while to get up to Berkeley. It's funny,
the minute I go on vacation I sort of forget about the working world and assume
everyone else is on vacation as well. So I'm always a bit surprised to get on
the road during rush hour and discover that a normal 1.5 hour drive has turned
magically into an almost 3 hour slog.

But we still managed to arrive on time, which for a Metal show is actually
unreasonably early. So Hil and I had a minute to look around for any nearby
{% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} restaurants. This being Berkeley we
of course had an embarrassment of riches in terms of options, and we settled
on the excellent [Flacos](http://www.flacos.com/about.html). The food was
outstanding, and quite spicy. It's rare to find a vegan Mexican restaurant so
it feels like a special treat when we do.

The gig wasn't our best, but we muddled through. The crowd, outside of Hilary
of course, seemed mostly indifferent. During our soundcheck I overheard someone
on the staff saying that we were way, *way* too loud and we were asked to turn
down. I think that's easily the fourth or fifth gig running where volume has
been an issue like that. That's including, most memorably, the Blue Lagoon
gig where the manager of the venue stopped us mid-set with demands that we
turn down.

Have folks been enforcing noise laws more strictly recently? Or maybe it's our
guitarist's new amp setup. Whatever it is, I feel like we are systematically
alienating every small venue in California with our volume alone.

If that ain't rock and roll, I don't know what is.
