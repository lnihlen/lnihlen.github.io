The Zero needed its first service at 6000 miles, along with a firmware update.
There is a phone app for the Zero which theoretically can update the firmware
but it was reporting that the firmware version on the bike was too old for
updating via this route.

So I rode over the hill to San Jose BMW Motorcycles, where I got the Zero, and
dropped it off. Got there a tad early so I took a walk through the showroom
floor. Lots of pretty new Boxers and Vespas but I only had eyes for the new
model Zeros.

I gotta say, love the new military flat green paint scheme. Not that I'm
considering taking a big haircut (I assume) on trade-in and getting one for
a slightly bigger battery and much improved tank cosmetics but encouraging
to see them take a step in a more individual stylistic direction and one that
I agree with.

SJBMW is cool because they have loaner bikes. I got an older BMW GS. The helper
asked if I knew how to work a bike with gears, a sensible question (I quickly
realized) for someone arriving on a Zero. It felt very similar to my GSA, if
slightly older.

The helper pointed out that the ABS system was disabled and so the warning light
would flash intermittently, it was a known issue. Fine with me. I had fun riding
a different bike than normal, although the contrast between an aging BMW GSA
and the Zero hasn't been more obvious to me before.

I liked the sticker, a constant reminder to me that I need to go spend more time
on the [GHD](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-gh-1-ghd)!

Tomorrow we fly to LAX, rent a car, and drive to Disneyland!
