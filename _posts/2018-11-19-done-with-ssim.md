Took the day off from work for some rest and relaxation. Hilary's got a cold so
we thought we'd pass on camping for at least a day. Did some light recruiting
work, and ran errands "in town," but I had a few hours to dip into finishing
up the refactor for the variance unit tests. Then I was able to carry the
momentum forward and finish up all of the SSIM code and tests.

Then I actually had time to dig in a little to the libav stuff inside of ffmpeg.
I'm hoping to be able to put together a couple of integration programs in the
next few days.
