I bought myself a [Zero DSR](https://www.zeromotorcycles.com/zero-ds/) last
year based on a 5 minute test ride. That's all it took for me to understand that
electric motorcycles are the future of motorcycles, for me at least.

It's funny because I live in Santa Cruz, where the Zero motorcycles are
manufactured, so I thought I would be able to get one from the showroom at the
factory. I went down to the factory one Saturday with Hil to find the place
deserted except for a few friendly employees looking at us speculatively from
around the side while I tried to catch a glimpse of the bikes through the
glass in front window. Turns out, as they helpfully explained, the nearest
dealership, was San Jose BMW Motorcycles all the way on the other side of
"the Hill," as it were. So much for shopping locally.

In any event the DSR has become my primary commuting tool for all days with
beautiful weather, which around here is most days, strafing the 17 and then
splitting lanes on the parking lot that some folks call Highway 85 all the way
into the Mothership in Mountain View. It's a civilized way to get around in
an increasingly uncivil transportation environment.

There's much to like in the Zero. I hear the earlier models were plagued by
reliability issues but have had Zero problems with mine (hnurr hrr hrr). The
bike is lightweight and flickable, with smooth (and completely nutty) power
delivery right from rest. Everything you hear about electric cars applies
here too, same low-speed torque, same range anxiety. Range is strongly a
function of velocity during travel, of course, and to avoid a complicated and
probably boring discussion around my findings here let's say that I need to
charge at work in order to get home.

Laughably the Zero comes with a standard 3-prong computer power cable in the
accessory bag, and there's a receptacle for the business end of it under a
dust boot on the side of the frame. You can also opt for a 220V rapid charger
setup, which I did, primarily to charge at work and thus assure my ride home
goes smoothly. On 220V charging from about 1/3 battery takes a bit under 2
hours, keeping the (oversubscribed) charger sharing drama at work to a minimum.

Zero has clearly prioritized the sensible things here - the ride. The rest looks
and feels like it came from a much cheaper motorcycle. For instance the plastics
around where a gas tank would be on an ICE motorcycle have some funky styling
on them and scratch up super easy. The hand controls on the bars look and feel
somewhat low-end. This is said with love, I think Zero is not operating at
economies of scale like the big motorcycle companies and is doing the best
they can. But for a conventional motorcycle over $20K in price the generic
styling and cheap plastic bits really just wouldn't fly.

I've been excited to see some other companies start to become aware of
the potential of electric motorcycles and join the scene. I've never really
been captivated by Harleys but the
[LiveWire](https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/motorcycles/future-vehicles/livewire.html)
is super exciting because of what it represents - a traditionally stodgy
motorcycle company investing in electrics in a big way.

The [Curtiss Zeus](https://www.curtissmotorcycles.com/zeus) is getting a little
warmer, reminding me somewhat of the [Confederate](https://www.confederate.com/)
motorcycle stylings with the big yokes and geometric, minimalist frame. And
now the
[Curtiss Hera](https://electrek.co/2018/08/24/curtiss-introduces-the-worlds-first-v-8-battery-in-new-electric-motorcycle/),
announced today, is another matter entirely. We'll have to see what happens when
the design moves from CAD render to actuality, but I may have identified my
first ever cruiser.

.. of course, commuting on such a bike would be absolutely ridiculous, weaving
that thing through tightly-packed cars seems awkward and scary. And I don't
really ride my motorcycles except to commute. But since when has a motorcycle
been a practical expenditure anyway?
