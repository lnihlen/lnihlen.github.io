The desk in the living room has been a great experiment, and I have full
intention of recreating that situation soon, but I've been feeling the itch
to plug in and turn on all of my synth gear at once. So it was with only some
reluctance that this afternoon I dismantled the workstation setup and started
dragging gear from various other places around the house and garage into my
office.

There are still some open questions around how I can wire all of it together,
where to put the monitors, etc. So that's going to be quite a project going
forward. Also, pretty important to get the workstation put back together
double-quick, because of all the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}
homework I have brewing.

We've started the traditional Harry Potter movie cycle. We polished off the
first movie yesterday afternoon, and are working on the second and third movies
today. While the first two movies are fun, I think the third is where they
really start to get good. Poor Harry, stuck at Hogwarts while everyone else
gets to go to Hogsmeade. But I have a feeling the Weasley twins have something
to say about that.
