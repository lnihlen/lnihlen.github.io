One of the more recent Lynda Thompson movies is
[Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Freak:_The_Vampire%27s_Assistant). There have been a couple of rough ones so when we started this movie tonight
I have to admit expectations were low. But it's surprisingly entertaining, sort
of a fun adventure movie, a cross between a fun (if unoriginal) take on
vampirism and a Harry Potter style wizard school trip. I was stoked to notice
it's a movie based on a novel series. I'll probably queue those up in audiobook
form, to listen too once I get through the whole Expanse series of books.

I don't generally take the motorbike to work in the rain if I can help it, and
the rain always seems to bring out the worst in the bay area drivers,
particularly on the 17, so I spent around 3 hours in the car today going to
and fro. Making some good headway on the second novel in the Expanse series.
I had watched the first season of the TV show, and enjoyed it, but sort of lost
interest partway into the second season. The books are pretty different, at
least in terms of timing of introduction of characters and perspectives, and
I'm enjoying them a great deal more.

12 days to go.
