The modern Silicon Valley software engineering job comes with a lot of perks
designed to entice you to stay at work, or to enable you to live at work, or
to allow you to work unburdened from things that might normally conspire to
keep you at home. I don't take a lot of advantage of much of these, and there's
a fairly strong generational gap I notice in a person's willingness to spend
time at work just "hanging out," not getting stuff done but maybe doing laundry
or hitting a nap pod or what have you. I have a bed at home, along with a
washing machine, along with a wonderful wife, two dogs and a cat. Why would I
spend more time away from them than is strictly necessary?

Suffice to say, I don't really have an instinct when it comes to planning
"team building" offsite events. Or by "instinct" perhaps what I'm trying to say
is that my inclination is get work done at work, then get home, so I don't
naturally assume that people want to spend a bunch of time during work hours
doing something that doesn't get their work done. Particularly because we will
all be expected to still get that work done, and will have to make up the time.

But they are effective, offsites. This is something I've learned observing
parts of my team do smaller offsites that they had organized, then invited me
along for the ride. As a leader it's a unique opportunity to observe team
dynamics outside of the context of work. Furthermore, it allows people to
connect with one another on a more human level, which can really help to keep
a team collaborating and communicating on a constructive basis.

So, I've taken it upon myself to organize team-wide offsites on a quarterly
basis. Figuring offsites that haven't been done to death in the valley, that
reflect my unique character as a leader, and that aren't centered around
alcohol or food, as a {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} nondrinker, took
some thinking. But I remembered my long-standing interest in the Japanese
martial art of [Kyudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABd%C5%8D), and with
a little Googling found a beautiful dojo in the mountains near La Honda.

We carpooled out there, and as folks arrived and the instructors took us through
a brief warmup. I think this was the point where I got a real sense of the risk
I was taking here. There was some light physical activity, with varying levels
of physical ability in the room, after an hour's drive into the woods, doing
this weird obscure martial art. You could tell the team was playing along,
giving me a fair amount of benefit of the doubt. As a manager and leader I try
to be aware of when the trust of the team is being tested, and this was
definitely a moment.

After the warmup they had us sit to the side and showed us a two-person shooting
demonstration. The dojo space is enclosed but has floor-to-ceiling glass doors
along one side which open on to the firing range.

At the end everyone had a chance to fire a few arrows and try to hit the tiny
target way down at the end of the range. And the team was laughing,
photographing each other with the enormous asymmetrical bows, comparing notes,
and just generally having a good time. Hopefully most would say it was a
successful offsite.

Now I have to top it next time. Maybe baking? We'll have to see.
