So I bought a house at 22, long time ago in Albuquerque. It was what they call
a "shotgun" house, all laid out in a line, with a front room leading to a
kitchen, through the kitchen a small hallway with the bathroom on the right,
and a single back room.

Living with my then wife, we slept in the back room so the front room served
as both the living room and my office. I learned to work on a computer with
a TV on, and many seasons of Buffy and Angel soaked into my subconscious
along with the Real Housewives of Diverse Affluent Cities.

I think I've developed a taste for these shows but only can really enjoy them
as a secondary activity, like while focused on a computer primarily, either
playing games, writing code, or even just surfing the Internet.

Now Hil is re-watching a show from her past,
[The Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hills_(TV_series). I gotta say
I'm hooked.

Nothing more intelligent to say tonight, got home late and had homework until
10, and the Hills were on for a bit. All caught up in Heidi and Spencer drama.
He's such a jerk.
