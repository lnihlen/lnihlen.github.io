A very merry birthday to my dearest love, my heart's delight, my wife Hilary.

To celebrate she drove up Mountain View to meet me after work. We then sat in a
car for 90 minutes to drive the 35 miles in to San Francisco, then got in line
and waited an additional two hours to get a table at
[Shizen](https://www.shizensf.com/), a vegan sushi bar. And it was completely
worth all of it, with out a doubt.

Everything at this place is remarkable. We first went there this April for my
birthday, and despite the distance and hassle it has become our spot for
special occasion dining. So much so that Hilary, who is not a vegan, requested
it for her dinner meal, despite reassurance from me that I would have happily
accompanied her to more traditional fish-based sushi restaurant, which are of
course quite plentiful in the bay area.

One of the delightful agonies of the place is that everything on the menu
that we've tried has been exquisite, and everything on the menu that we haven't
tried also looks appealing, and thus begins the debate of exploration versus
iteration. The lengthy wait (they are a tiny spot and don't accept reservations)
only increases the anticipation, allowing you to plan, revise, and rehearse your
order ad infinitum while you watch the various now-familiar faces of your
waiting, ravenous cohort dwindle to your own lucky table appointment.

This time I finally opted for the Ramen, with a spicy garlic miso broth. It
was rich and satisfying. In particular there was some exquisitely prepared
tofu chasu. The depth of flavor and smoky umami in that tofu I don't think I've
encountered before in tofu.

If you find yourself in or around San Francisco I'd highly recommend a trip.
Just get there as early as you can, to cut down on the wait. After a certain
point they put up a sign and won't even accept names on the list.
