Hilary went and taught her afternoon yoga kids class at Luma, so it was another
luxurious lazy afternoon spent largely on the couch playing Red Dead Redemption
2. I'd say I'm probably about 4 hours in now, and its claws are starting to
sink in. I played until it got dark out, then cooked dinner. Now Hilary and I
are polishing off another Lynda Thompson movie, Herbie Fully Loaded. I don't
think we are anywhere near the target demographic for this one.

There's a {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal on Monday, so I'll
need to spend some time tomorrow preparing. Realistically, then, I'm not seeing
another chance to play again for a bit, which is probably for the best. The
call of the West is a strong one at the moment.
