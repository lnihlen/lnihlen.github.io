I'm starting to feel like it's time to buck up and face the cold winter weather
on my motorcycle again, because the commute times right now seem to be spiraling
ever closer to 2 hours one way and it is seriously making me question my life
choices. Yes, listening to the Expanse audiobooks on Google Play Books is great
fun, but sitting in a car for three plus hours, even a really nice car, isn't
cutting it. On paper the math just never makes sense - risk life and limb by
riding a motorbike to work in order to save two hours in the car each day. At
least for me, the equation shifts about 20 minutes in to my morning commute.

Got some feedback from Bruno about a student rehearsal of
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} today that, aside from an annoying
usability issue I hadn't noticed, went relatively smoothly. He also came back
with a prioritized list of features which I'm going to try and burn through
by Friday, the next rehearsal. So we'll see how that fits in with the ~4 hour
a day commute issues.

Tomorrow I'm doing another fill-in at {% include tag_link.html tag="kfjc" %}
from 6am - 10am, so at least the AM part of the commute will be relatively
humane, as I'll probably leave the house around 4:30 am. So it's an early night
for me tonight, off to bed as quick as I can.
