It rained on and off all day, and short of a workout in the garage gym my
motivation to stray far from the couch was low. I still found some time to
fiddle a bit with the
[neuron](https://github.com/lnihlen/sc/blob/master/sounds/2019-01-04-neurons.scd)
sound. Two sounds I can imagine for inspiration are the sounds of steam escaping
from wet firewood while it is burning, or the sounds of styrofoam squeaking
under compression or torsion.

There was also plenty of time for just weekending as well. I got some progress
in on the Phantasy Star 3 walkthrough, watched a bunch of TV, and cuddled
with the dogs and our cat. I'm going to miss this crew, so it was good to spend
some time snuggling with everyone before I head out to Las Vegas tomorrow for
[CES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show).

What a luxurious day, it felt like a bit of shrapnel from the vacation blowout
got stuck into my work routine and *I'm loving it*.
