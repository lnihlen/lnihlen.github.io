Attended a lovely wedding with Hilary today at an AirBnB in the middle of
nowhere an hour's drive outside of Palm Desert. It was an emotional, beautiful
ceremony, and then we transitioned into a nearby tent for home-cooked Mexican
food and dancing.

I didn't know anyone at the wedding, and Hilary knew only a few people, so we
mostly made small talk with them. Of course, the conversation inevitably moved
to my place of employment. Then someone had to comment that I must be "the
evilest person in the room." Another person wanted to know if it was really
true that Google had uploaded a copy of their soul, and in the event of their
death was expecting I would get an email about it, and.. something. I'm a little
unclear about what they were expecting would happen next.

I respect the opportunity of working at Google. I also recognize that I'm lucky
and privileged to do so. My work is meaningful to me personally and I'm proud
of where I work.

I often get some pretty intense reactions from folks when I talk about my work,
particularly outside of Silicon Valley. Inside Silicon Valley I think Googlers
are a dime a dozen so there's less of that kind of reaction.

I do think there's something to it, this hostility towards Googlers. In the Bay
Area there's a lot about income inequality to process, and so the uncomfortable,
angry discussion often revolves around people pressuring me to divulge anything
about my income. One common pressure tactic is for the interlocutor to share,
in excruciating detail, various facts about their experience of poverty.

Outside of the Bay Area I think it's more generalized anxiety about the fact
that Google, and technology in general, have become a central part of our lives.
We are dependent on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and the Internet in
general. And the only accountability these companies have to their customers
is the same accountability any company has to its customers, through the
almighty dollar.

So I try to bear that in mind when people say hurtful things to me, or demand
some sort of accounting by me for my choice of employers. But that doesn't mean
it doesn't hurt, more that I'm doing my best to remember to not be a jerk back
to people. Also, although I am in no way a representative of my employer, am
not authorized to speak on Google's behalf, and wouldn't even begin to presume
to think that I was qualified to do so, I am aware that in that conversation,
for those people, I am reflecting on my company. So I try my best to answer their
bizarre, uninformed, ignorant, rude, and insulting questions.

I worked my ass for 20 years to get to where I am in my career. I wanted a job
that mattered, and I'm at The Big Show. You think I'm going to quit now because
of your anxieties about your relationship with technology? Would it make a
difference anyway?
