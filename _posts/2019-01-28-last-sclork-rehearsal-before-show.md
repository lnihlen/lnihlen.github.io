We've been meeting every Monday night to prepare for the Public Domain piece
performance by {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} this Wednesday. I'm
pretty nervous about bugs but all of the rehearsals do help. I was realizing
that basically every piece of software that I've developed for SCLOrk will be
deployed for this show:

  * [SCLOrkNet](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkNet)
  * [SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat)
  * [SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock)
  * [SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD)
  * The Gentoo server that powers the network and Supercollider server components

So I'm glad we did three dry runs tonight, and the larger student ensemble
has been hammering on the code, three times a week, for a few weeks now. Of
course, there's always the additional pressure of a live performance, which can
typically bring out the worst in software.

I'll be getting to the performance space on Wednesday extra early, with the hope
that we can do some validation of the stage setup and fix any problems that
arise before, you know, like any *actual people* show up expecting that there
will be music coming out of our speakers.

Exciting!

I got to ride the motorcycle in to work this morning. It's funny because I'll
spend time away from riding, and I'll start to forget why it is that I love to
ride. Then 15 minutes on the bike and it all comes right back. So good to be
riding again. I hear the rain is coming back later this week, so I guess get
it while I can. I know points east of here are about to get hammered in the
cold weather, and I can only sympathize. It's entirely true that living in
Northern California has softened me for weather.

Meanwhile, I've been slowly accruing parts to try out some higher-quality field
recording sessions coming up soon. I'm thinking once the weather turns a bit
more Hil and I can do some camping weekends to try out some remote nature
recordings. There's also plenty I want to try and capture around the Google
campus, industrial sounds mostly. So that'll be fun too.
