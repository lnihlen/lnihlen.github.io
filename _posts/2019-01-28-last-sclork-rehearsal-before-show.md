We've been meeting every Monday night to prepare for the Public Domain piece
performance by {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} this Wednesday. I'm
pretty nervous about bugs but all of the rehearsals do help. I was realizing
that basically every piece of software that I've developed for SCLOrk will be
deployed for this show:

  * [SCLOrkNet](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkNet)
  * [SCLOrkChat](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkChat)
  * [SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock)
  * [SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD)
  * The Gentoo server that powers the network and Supercollider server components

So I'm glad we did like three dry runs tonight, and the larger student ensemble
has been hammering on the code, three times a week, for a few weeks now. Of
course, there's always the additional pressure of a live performance, which can
typically bring out the worst in software.

I'll be getting to the performance space on Wednesday extra early, with the hope
that we can do some validation of the stage setup and fix any problems that
arise before, you know, like any *actual people* show up expecting that there
will be music coming out of our speakers.

Exciting!
