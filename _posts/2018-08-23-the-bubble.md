I've been re-reading [Dhalgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhalgren), which
I first encountered when working on my project to read all of the 
[Nebula award winning novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award_for_Best_Novel)
in order, and while it didn't win one it was a runner-up and somehow caught my
eye.

It's a powerful work and, in part, describes the experience of a small remainder
of survivors and new arrivals in a city, Bollona. It seems like popular culture
is littered with these fantasies of lone survivors in a crumbling urban ruin,
particularly the latest glut of zombie stories.

Also rattling around are the early observations of Internet culture that the
Internet may one day eradicate all need for actual human contact, and now
starting to see some of that happen, with driverless cars and drone delivery of
groceries, bots and other automatic sources of online communications, other
robotic services like house cleaning.

Thinking about [shut-in culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori),
particularly among the wealthy, and I start to be able to imagine scenarios
where there could be a world-ending scenario causing the loss of most human
lives and some privileged recluse may not even notice right away.

One additional twist is the idea of invisibility of women, working class folk,
LGTBQ, and people of color. Working a white-collar job, the staff don't
generally mix with the folks keeping the place clean, stocking the snack bar,
cooking in the cafeteria, watering the plants, and in general keeping the
office work space comfortable, habitable, orderly, secure, and clean.

Meaning in particular you wouldn't need robots, really, just really good
customer service, because we all know the best service is *invisible*.

For some folks raised in privilege they may never have had to understand what
happens to the laundry from its trip from hamper (or floor) to neatly folded
and ready for use again. I remember my first year in a private college there
was a period of about a month where some of my male colleagues in the co-ed
dorm were asking me to show them how to do laundry, because their parent's
home was too far for them to conveniently return on the weekend for their
mothers to do their laundry. And (I reason) they never had to do it themselves
before in their lives. Then, after that month of time, they stopped asking
because they had all found girlfriends (or a laundry service) to do it for
them.

So this begs the question - what if one of these apocalypse stories of the lone
survivor was instead just an elaborate fantasy by a reclusive privileged
white man who had already cut human interaction down to a minimum, so that
moving on to fantasy of apocalypse became a very easy step, such that any
reasonable person could take?

Then, imagine if this person was rich enough that those around them might just
go ahead and entertain that fantasy? How hard would that man have to be pushed
in order to break the spell? Could you, after having gone down the road for a
while, begin to have real difficulty in believing the truth again?
