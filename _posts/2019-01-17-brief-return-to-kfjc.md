I got up extra early this morning to drive over the hill to DJ at KFJC. This
would be the first [radio show](https://www.kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58416)
I've done in a while there. It was great fun. I played a few old favorites
and enjoyed digging through the new releases. There's always a few gems for
us noise fans in KFJC's current, thanks to their excellent music department.
It makes sounding like a badass easier. With my work schedule being what it is
I'm not sure if I can sign up for another 6a-10a any time soon, but it was
pretty fun.

Short work day because I came back home early for a doctor's appointment. I
feel lucky I did, too, because it turns out that the hard rain on this side
of the hill once again complicated the trip over highway 17. This time it looks
like there was a bad accident somewhere around Summit road. I've noticed before
that every time it rains I seem to see a vehicle turned on its side on that
one turn on the underpass, or at least some road flares burning out a warning
after the cleanup crew has gone.

Sometimes living in the mountain can be a bit spooky like that. I heard that
a huge boulder fell down and is once again blocking access to Big Sur. The last
hard winter cut those poor folks off for a while. I still sometimes feel that
living in California can test one's resolve to remain here in ways that New
Mexico never did.

And I still feel it's entirely worth it, without a doubt in my mind.
