One thing that working on this blog has taught me is how little time I have to
work on stuff that isn't my day job as an engineering manager. I'm
in middle management, working my way slowly (way more slowly than I'd like)
through the glut of folks at my level, all of whom are smart, ambitious, and
motivated, looking for some edge or opportunity to distinguish themselves from
the herd and gain a foothold on the ladder leading to the executive class.

I live in Santa Cruz and work in Mountain View, because I couldn't find a way
to live in Silicon Valley that I be comfortable in *and* comfortably afford.
I get up early most days to work out, because I find that if I don't work out
first thing in the day the likelihood of me working out later in the day
plummets. So, up at 5:30, work out, eat, commute, work 8-10 hours, commute,
eat, then somewhere between 0-4 hours of homework, then comes the free time.

When you look at how my spend my time everything else that I might identify as;
devoted husband, athlete, blogger, experimental software engineer, musician, etc
seems like it more honestly should be prefixed with the word *aspirational*, as
in *I aspire to be* all of these other things, but only have a few hours during
the work week with which to devote to these endeavors.

I chose to be a software engineer as a career. A few years ago, I made the choice
to switch to management and focus on that as an endeavor. I'm proud of that,
and I (mostly) enjoy my job. But this whole "do what you love" thing has been
rightly called out by others on the 'net about how privileged it is, and how
blind it is to differences of class and access to opportunity.

I have no doubt in my mind that if I didn't have to work for a living that there
would be some aspects of my job I would still be engaged in. But certainly not
all of them, and certainly not at the pace or workload that I routinely follow.

I work for a living. I have to work for a living. I'd like to work on something
meaningful, with people that I admire, trust, and respect, and on something
that has a large scale. Given my background, skills, and training, the career
that I have is where I ended up. It represents a local maximum in a complex
multi-objective optimization function. And it consumes the lion's share of my
time, emotional and physical energy, each and every work day.

I also don't like to blog about it a ton. There's a lot of negative sentiment
about Googlers in the Bay Area. It's complicated. Also, much of what I work on
is confidential. And this is an entirely personal blog, not a professional one.
It has been tough, however, to sit in front of an empty vim buffer work night
after work night and just have *nothing* of note to say on a given day that
isn't so work-related that it's over the line of talking about work on a
personal blog.

So, perhaps the point of writing this blog is to remind me that I am a person
outside of work, that there are people and efforts outside of work that are
meaningful and interesting. But I chose my life, I'm no victim. Far from it,
I'm incredibly lucky and so grateful to have the opportunity and ability to
do what I do.

And, some nights, we get takeout from [Oren's](https://orenshummus.com/menu/),
and I don't have the energy to do much outside of sitting on the couch. Yes, I
chose this, yes, I'm lucky. The trick is to believe that it is enough.
