If I'm honest one of the best things about doing a radio show starting at 6am
on a Thursday is that there's absolutely nobody expecting anything from me, or
wanting my attention, for 4 whole hours. That doesn't happen all week, usually.
This is especially true when you play harsh noise, like I
[did this morning](https://kfjc.org/listen/playlist?i=58465). There probably
aren't even very many people, if any, *listening* to the show, let alone
expecting anything from me during that time.

So, particularly with the long tracks, it can be a fairly productive and
creative time for me. Because of the crunch on
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} right now I was mostly focusing on
that. I was able to push out two separate revisions to
[SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD) based on separate rounds of
feedback from Bruno. I think we're getting close to a pretty usable first
draft of that Quark, which I'm stoked on, seeing that we went from concept
to working prototype in under two weeks.

I also got to drop by Aaron's place after work for a review of a song we're
apparently going to be focusing on at rehearsal this Saturday. Of course I
haven't had as much time as I would like to practice this week. Perhaps
tomorrow night I can crank out a session on the practice pad.

Work's starting to kick up again in a big way, so probably will have to cut
back on some of the music stuff pretty soon. But enjoying it as long as it
lasts.
