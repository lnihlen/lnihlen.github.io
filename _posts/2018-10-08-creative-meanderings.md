Hilary is back from Accessible Yoga training in LA. We were catching up, talking
about her experience there. One of the things that struck her was that she had
no immediate, practical use for her training in this area. Specifically, she
is not at a Yoga studio that includes a clientele with a diversity of different
needs, and has no line on an independent contractor endeavor focused on Yoga
for the disabled.

What's very clear to me as her loving supporter as that she's building towards
something, each thing that she learns, each experience that she has, advancing
her towards some ultimate realization. What's challenging and scary about that
is that neither of us know what her destination looks like.

Talking about myself again, I think it's the same sort of process when it comes
to many things in my life, particularly around creative stuff like music. I
don't know what the destination looks like. So it's hard to gauge myself against
any kind of progress towards some ultimate goal as a musician.

At work, there's the next rung on the ladder, the next step up in terms of
responsibility, status, and pay. But even at work it's not so cut-and-dried.
Particularly at Google, folks are strongly encouraged to define their own
role. Meaning, each of us needs to figure out how we can make impact, create
value for the company, and do that more.

So I learn a little {% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %}, play some
drums in {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %}, go hack on
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %}, maybe take piano lessons again, or
I've been thinking about ordering a flute or a cello. I'm planning on installing
Gentoo on the Raspberry Pi, and have a fanless rackmount computer on order
to serve as a DHCP server along with other elements in a potential solo
project, or some synchronized clock experimentation in
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %}. There's the backlog, with the
{% include tag_link.html tag="phone_spam_hashery" %}, painting some minis for
{% include tag_link.html tag="wh40k" %}, maybe mess with the
{% include tag_link.html tag="modular" %} synth stuff, etc.

Point being, I'm all over the map, always tinkering and puttering around.
There's this expectation of mastery I think in hobbies these days. Now that I'm
in a better headspace (cbd oil, thank you!) I'm starting to be ok with holding
two separate visions in my head at the same time:

  * I can trust my own creative instincts, follow my interests, learning as I
    go, and that ultimately I will arrive at something really interesting,
    valuable, or compelling to others.
  * Perhaps it's totally fine if this meandering serves no ultimate goal or
    purpose, either, and the entire point *is the journey itself*.

Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
