With a second day of no burning priorities in terms of building infrastructure
for the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} show this coming Wednesday
I found myself again with some free time, and (to be honest) no strong
temptation to start hacking on another project.

The weather has turned, so I spent a minute going over the motorcycles to make
sure that, should the mood strike, I could hop on one for a trip over the hill
this week. I also took a poke around the camper, to ensure it had survived the
weather without issue. It's likely the rains are going to return later in the
week but a few clear days really does feel great.

The band came over for an atypical {% include tag_link.html tag="oort_cloud" %}
rehearsal. We're getting ready for our KZSU Day of Noise performance, so just
focusing on noise and with some additional personnel, including Hilary! It's
always fun when Hilary sits in on a set. I decided to rerack a bunch of modules
specifically for a noise set, but the band showed up before I could finish,
so I was practicing on a bunch of modules not screwed down. Not incredibly
safe, I'll admit, but I think I might do that some in the future as a great
way to get a sense of if the flow and organization of the system makes sense
to me.

I noticed this noise set I felt a lot more comfortable in my own skin, as well
as in control of my instrument. I really think those
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsals are paying off!

Leftover lasagne from yesterday, and I'm playing a bunch of Zelda 2. I know
there's lots of other things I could be doing, but it feels good to not be
doing them.
