Woke up in Santa Monica after paying back (hopefully) a bit of that sleep debt
from working the night before. Then I tried to get a workout in at the hotel
gym. I don't know what it is that hotel gyms have against barbells. They at
least had a few dumbbells, so with some modifications to my workout, I was
able to muddle through.

When we're in LA, if feasible, we go to Empanada's Place, in Palms.
Unfortunately they lack {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} options but
even veggies can find something to like here. This is an old-school family
business, kid pictures and trophies on the wall, the older brother working the
till. Classic LA vibes, and wonderful food.

Then around an hour of LA traffic before exiting the 5 on to Disneyland Drive.
We typically stay at the Grand Californian, finding it a little more quiet and
comfortable than the (don't get me wrong, still excellent) Disneyland Hotel. We
often joke between ourselves that the hotel is so realistic, it's almost like we
were in California.

There's a couple of cool vegan restaurants "off campus" as Hil and I have come
to refer to all things outside of the all-encompassing resort. I think it's been
at least a year since we went to Vegan Pizza so I was pleased to see that they
were still open and had in fact expanded to the adjacent unit for more eat-in
dining.

I think I remember recently writing here that I almost never get to eat pizza
as a vegan but here we were so capitalized on the opportunity. Hil spotted
a mysterious reddish-orange hot sauce and so brought it over along with some
napkins. I recognize the myriad ways, some of them huge but tons of them small,
she improves my life.

Tomorrow is park day.
