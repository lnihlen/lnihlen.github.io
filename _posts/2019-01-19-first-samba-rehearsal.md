It was up a bit earlier than usual for a Saturday and back over the hill for
rehearsal with Bloco Del Sol San Jose. It was super fun. I got there early
(so on time, for me) walked over to grab a latte from a local cafe, and then
met Aaron to set up the room. The group practices in the Mexican Heritage
Center in East San Jose. This is an impressive facility, Aaron was sharing that
there are frequent weddings there. and walking through the grounds to the
classroom where were to rehearse I could definitely see why. There was a
building on the grounds, single story, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a
beautiful hardwood floor. I remember walking past it and hoping that we would
be rehearsing there, just because it seemed like such an awesome space.

Folks started showing up, and everyone was super friendly. I was really glad
that Aaron took the time to prep me a bit early in the week, because the
rehearsal started pretty much on time and within 60 seconds I was playing in
unison with 6 or so other snare drum players through the first numbers.

Brazilian Samba is funky as all getout. It was super fun to hear how the stick
patterns I had been practicing fit in with the other drums in the Bloco. We
played for almost two hours. I don't think I've done that much snare work since
I was auditioning to be a percussion performance major back at UNM in my early
20s.

After what feels like weeks of rain it was great to see the sun out. The hills
in East San Jose, normally more on the brown/golden side, are a verdant green.
After lunch at Cafe Cruz and some grocery shopping Hil and I managed to squeeze
in a trip to the beach in Watsonville with the doggies. With so much rain
they've been going a bit stir crazy pent up in the yard and house.

The only thing about today is that the {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork %}
rehearsal is one day closer and I still really don't have line of sight on
building that UI for our most recent piece.

I'm really hoping to get some time, maybe later tonight but definitely tomorrow,
to try and fix that. The problem is that the project keeps mushrooming into
more complication and work, because I can't find a "quick and dirty" way to
build the code we proposed that I'm happy with.

Maybe if I lock myself in my office until I come up with something suitable?
