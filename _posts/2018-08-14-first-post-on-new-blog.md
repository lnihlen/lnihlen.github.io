After literally years of silence on the blog I'm going to take another crack at
writing routinely here. I think there's been a few reasons why I didn't blog
consistently or frequently with the old system:

1. A lot of concern about audience. Who is the audience of a blog? What is the
purpose of this blog? Who cares? If I post political views here will there be
retaliation (a real possibility in these times). If I talk about work or
personal matters what are the repercussions?

2. Blogspot. Learning this tool, which seems very heavyweight for my needs,
requires an Internet connection, and every time I went back I had to re-learn
how to make a new posting, post an image, and so on.

3. A sense of shame about not posting new things, despite the first posting of
the blog being very ambitious and setting out a direction that turned out to
be completely not at all what I was on about very shortly thereafter.

For number 3 I'm going to set out the expectation right now that the only domain
of this blog is my own writing, in my own words. Hopefully that will be
sufficient scope that I don't wander too far out of bounds. :). I have
some ideas about ways to organize content into tags, which feels super premature
in an initial posting, so saving for later when relevant,
[YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) and all that.
Also I'm going to promise to myself and others there will be dry spells, format
changes, flaky behavior, irrelevance, tangents. Who cares?

Number 2 is easy too, the switch to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), while a bit
sparse on documentation, follows from the observation that I seem to be most
comfortable and productive working in a [vim](https://www.vim.org) terminal on
files living within a git client. My most prolific and productive writing and
software personal projects have all been under these conditions. Also web
programming also feels like a huge distraction from the act of writing, which
is what I'd like this blog to focus on.

As for number 1 - I really can't say. Putting up a blog is putting yourself out
there in a unique way. I don't generally publicize these sorts of things, I'm
not even sure what my expectations are in investing time and energy in to this,
other than that I've always felt I should develop as a writer, I have lots that
I want to say, and never really liked the feeling of writing a private journal.
I've gotten a lot of value out of various blog postings in my Internet travels,
such as reading helpful how-tos and explanations, opinion pieces, nonfiction
stuff and recipes. I li1ke blogs. I think even in this time of microcontent and
centralization on a major site like Instragram it's cool to read somebody's
words on their own page. Hopefully you find something here worth your time,
but if you are here hopefully it's because you found your own way here, instead
of this content being forced on you.
