Had some {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} nachos at Saturn with Hilary
for dinner, got home around 8. It was a bit unsettling for a second because I
wasn't trying to cram every second into hacking away on the
{% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} composition piece. It was a bit
disorienting, to be honest, but not unpleasant, to not feel the pressing need
to grab my laptop and start hacking away on the latest list of bugfixes and
feature requests for the [SCLOrkPD](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkPD).

There's a few tweaks left on that, and then perhaps I can switch gears over to
the [SCLOrkClock](https://github.com/lnihlen/SCLOrkClock). Or maybe I can take
a few days off, play some video games, or maybe hack on
{% include tag_link.html tag="vcsmc" %} a bit. Been thinking about the fact that
I'm now doing evolution on a keyframe group, I could adjust the SSIM algorithm
to also consider the time domain. I think I recall seeing a paper about that
from the SSIM folks.

SuperCollider is super fun to hack in, but it has been an intense few days.
