![Hilary at Breakfast in Disneyland]({{ "assets/img/blog/2018-09-15-1.png" | absolute_url }})

After I got in a serious relationship with Hilary it took me a little while to
understand just how important Disneyland is to Hilary. And then it took a bit
longer to convince her to try revisiting the park as an adult. But, once we
agreed to go for her birthday a few years back, we've gone at least once every
year since. If I'm counting correctly this is our fourth consecutive birthday
trip, and since we went for our fifth wedding anniversary this July, it's our
fifth trip together.

There's still a lot to learn about visiting the park, I mean, I'm aware of how
many blogs are out there devoted entirely to visiting this park. I also was
checking the news today, monitoring the status of folks both on the East Coast
and in the Philippines as they deal with hurricanes and tropical storms. But
today we went to Disneyland.

I kept a running tab on our activities for the day:

  * Character breakfast at Storyteller's Cafe, Hilary got a photo with Minnie
    Mouse.
  * We rode the monorail in to Disneyland. I'm always reminded of the monorail
    ride in Half Life, which does such a brilliant job of establishing the scene
    and narrative.

![Us with Rey]({{ "assets/img/blog/2018-09-15-2.png" | absolute_url }})

  * Met with Rey. I always think, waiting in line for these character encounters,
    that of course this is pretend, it's just some young person in a costume,
    and that it will be easy to be cool. But then you get in that room and it's
    just real enough, and they are talking to you, that it makes me completely
    star struck. Rey asked me what I do for the Resistance and I started
    gibbering about how I was nobody important, just a farmer, but we all had to
    do our bit.
  * Had a professional photo taken in front of the castle.
  * At this point Hilary remarked that we had been at Disneyland for an hour and
    hadn't ridden a single ride. So over to a perinnial favorite for us, the
    Teacup Ride.
  * It was right next door so we then did the Storybook Land ride, a first for
    me. A lot of the older rides to me just seem like you are moved past little
    dioramas but as a miniature maker I can usually find something to like,
    even if my plan is to steal the techniques on display for re-use in the
    grimdark hopeless future of {% include tag_link.html tag="wh40k" %}.
  * Small World Ride. A chance to revisit both 1960s aesthetics and political
    sensibilities.
  * We stopped for lunch at Carnation Cafe, which has a sure bet
    {% include tag_link.html tag="vegan" %} option on the menu, a vegan burger.
    Over lunch Hilary dug up a
    [great list](https://www.peta2.com/vegan-life/vegan-food-disneyland/) of
    other vegan choices on the park, in the hopes we could stay on the park for
    dinner, as we wanted to see the light show afterward.
  * Hil had noticed that pro photos were also available in front of the Walt
    statue, with the castle in the background, so we grabbed some of those too.
  * Last trip was the first time we tried to figure out FastPass, and this time
    Hil had her phone set up to get us in that. So we got FastPass for the
    Indiana Jones ride, and took the Jungle Cruise while we waited.
  * Hil grabbed a Dole Whip (they are vegan but not appetizing to me), and I
    got a pineapple slice. We took refuge from the heat and noise in a quiet
    nook between the Dole Whip station and the giant fencing that has been
    erected around the Tiki Room while it undergoes renovation.
  * Next was the Indiana Jones ride.
  * We then did the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction, which loops around the
    Blue Bayou restaurant before the action starts.
  * Our second attempt (ever) at Astro Blasters followed. I'm beginning to
    suspect that the different colors on the Z targets mean different point
    values. And I can never get a decent sight picture on those blaster guns
  * We were starting to feel a bit tired so got a FastPass for the Roger Rabbit
    Cartoon Spin, a first for us both, and just relaxed near the fountain
    outside of the ride until it was time to drop in.
  * Took the Disneyland Train to New Orleans Square, as I was hoping we could
    get some food at the River Belle Terrace, as they had some of the more
    appetizing dinner options as indicated on the vegan guide Hil found. But
    they were reservation-only, so we settled for Rancho del Zocalo nearby.
  * Then we stood around for an hour until the Fantasmic Light Show, which was
    fun, then began the long walk on aching feet back to the hotel room.

Tomorrow we do California Adventure, but will spend the afternoon chilling in
a cabana poolside, recovering from the noise and heat of the weekend.
