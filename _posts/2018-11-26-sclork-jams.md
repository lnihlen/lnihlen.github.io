Back to work today after a week off, which was surprisingly less painful than
I had thought it might be. With some other people off too my meeting load was a
bit lighter, meaning more time during the day to catch up on email and
organize my approach to the remaining 13 working days in the year (but who's
counting).

Then it was off to the last {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} rehearsal
of the year. Despite some "Hail Mary" fixes to the chat program right before
rehearsal we still were not able to really get a `BeaconClock` to synchronize
across the Gigabit Ethernet network, with &lt;1 ms ping times. There's got to
be some patch that will work but given our setup I'm starting to think it might
be smarter to build a server-controlled, centrally managed system for clock
synchronization. We already have a server, and I think centralized management
and control of a bunch of synchronized clocks, with one authoritative source,
seems so much easier than relying on an ad-hoc peer network.

Famous last words. But I do have some time coming up, after only *13 more
working days*, so there's some good time there to maybe dig up that Raspberry
Pi array and get it poppin'.

Oh, and congrats to NASA today for the InSight landing on Mars. Huge respect
to folks who can land a robot autonomously on *another freakin' planet.*
