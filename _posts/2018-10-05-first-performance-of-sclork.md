Google News picked up and showed me a few different articles about the
[excavator crash](https://patch.com/california/losgatos/chp-reopens-hwy-17s-1-sb-lane-upon-truck-crash-damages-overpass)
that I drove past last night. I guess they re-opened the 17 southbound earlier
today. I was worried it would be a longer wait, given the reports that there was
damage to the overpass that the tractor struck. After the winter of 2017 I've
learned to be very conscious of the state of Highway 17. Problems on that road,
particularly South of Los Gatos, can create serious problems for me, making it
difficult or impossible for me to get to work or home.

I was in the car today, too, compounding potential difficulties around traffic,
because I wouldn't have my normal "problem solving" capability with traffic that
I have on the motorbike. But I was in the car for a good reason, I was hauling
gear for my very first {% include tag_link.html tag="sclork" %} gig. Bruno, our
conductor, had organized on opportunity for us to perform at the First Friday
Art Walk in downtown San Jose.

We played 2 sets, each about 45 minutes long (ish). We didn't make any
recordings of this material this time, although I heard it at least implied
by a more experienced member of the group that some other performances have been
recorded.

While we're playing Bruno uses both traditional hand gestures, mostly to
indicate dynamics or to synchronize events, but also heavily relies on us all
having an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) window open
to a channel on FreeNode for direction. I like to imagine what the chat must
read like to somebody who happens by it. Definitely not the most unusual chat
happening on IRC at any given moment but certainly unconventional. I also think
that any recording of the performance should probably include a timestamped
version of the chatlog, for synchronized playback.

There were a few other artists, and after the last set of the night the group
packed things up. I helped load some of the gear but started to feel like I was
just standing around, so asked to be excused. It was hugs and handshakes all
around, and I find myself suddenly with some new friends, some co-consiprators
and colleagues in this crazy art music endeavor. If nothing else had happened,
that outcome alone made the night entirely worth it.

Looking forward, with genuine relish, to our next rehearsal.
