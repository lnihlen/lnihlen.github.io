I started this tag with the idea that Solitary Bees would be a music label for self-publishing, but I haven't made any
music recently suitable for that. Meanwhile, I've begun a field recording project and I think that is the rightful name
of that project.

I'm interested in locations that are on the boundary between suburban or urban and wild spaces. Many of these spaces are
also impacted by climate change and are in some precarity. I want to document these spaces and share them online, with
field recordings, writing, and photography.
