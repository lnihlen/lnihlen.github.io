[Scintillator](https://github.com/lnihlen/Scintillator) is a Quark for
{% include tag_link.html tag="supercollider" %} as well as a
[standalone server binary](https://github.com/lnihlen/ScintillatorSynth) that
uses Vulkan to provide cutting-edge hardware-accelerated video synthesis for
SuperCollider or any other OSC control software. I think SuperCollider deserves
a great video plugin, and I wanted to learn Vulkan with a nontrival project,
and I didn't like how all the hardware video synth gear only renders at 480p,
so here we are.
