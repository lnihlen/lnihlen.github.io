Way back in undergrad days (or maybe it was grad?) I took a class on algorithmic
composition at UNM. The curriculum was built around Max, and while I enjoyed
listening to some of the works of the other students I was never able to really
be inspired by Max. I have a license to Max, which I periodically have
refreshed, and I think I've tried to go through a self-guided study course in
Max at least half a dozen times over the years.

Fast-forward to earlier this year when Hil found a seminar happening at Foothill
College where Roger Lin was going to come in and speak about his Linnstrument.
We attended, and our attendance was noteworthy because I think everyone else
at the talk was a student in the same class.

The talk was mostly a sales pitch for the Linnstrument, so was a bit lost on me
because I had decided long ago to get one, having discovered it on my own while
surfing around for nontraditional MIDI controllers. So once Roger opened it up
for demo and Q&A we quietly tried to slip out the back.

Eric, the instructor for the class whose students made up the rest of the
attendees of the talk, caught us on the way out as he was curious about how we
had heard about the class. We chatted for a bit and I expressed my frustration
with Max, that I already knew how to program and felt that Max's visual
approach to programming, while probably great for folks less comfortable with
an empty vim buffer, mostly got in my way.

Eric suggested I explore supercollider, and that was the start of it. I
downloaded it that night, and fell down that rabbit hole, having yet to emerge.
